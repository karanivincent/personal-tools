The NFL's new playoff overtime rules -- both teams are guaranteed at least one possession in the extra period -- were in effect for the first time, and the Chiefs needed to answer the Niners' field goal.\\\\\\\\n Held out of the end zone until that point, Kansas City grabbed its first lead of the game at 13-10.\\\\\\\\nJennings' touchdown receiving (followed by a missed extra point) concluded a 75-yard drive that put the Niners back on top, 16-13, as the wideout joined former Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Nick Foles as the only players to throw and catch a touchdown in a Super Bowl.\\\\\\\\n He spread the ball around -- eight pass-catchers had at least two receptions -- slowly but surely overcoming a threatening 49ers defense that knocked him off his spot consistently in the first half.\\\\\\\\nMahomes, with his third Super Bowl MVP, now sits alongside Tom Brady (five) and Joe Montana (three) atop the mountain while becoming just the third player to win the award back-to-back, joining Bart Starr (I-II) and Terry Bradshaw (XIII-XIV).\\\\\\\\n The muffed punt that bounced off of cornerback Darrell Luter Jr.'s ankle was also the big break that the Chiefs needed as they scored on the very next play to take the lead for the first time in the game.

The NFL's new playoff overtime rules -- both teams are guaranteed at least one possession in the extra period -- were in effect for the first time, and the Chiefs needed to answer the Niners' field goal.\\\\\\\\n Held out of the end zone until that point, Kansas City grabbed its first lead of the game at 13-10.\\\\\\\\nJennings' touchdown receiving (followed by a missed extra point) concluded a 75-yard drive that put the Niners back on top, 16-13, as the wideout joined former Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Nick Foles as the only players to throw and catch a touchdown in a Super Bowl.\\\\\\\\n He spread the ball around -- eight pass-catchers had at least two receptions -- slowly but surely overcoming a threatening 49ers defense that knocked him off his spot consistently in the first half.\\\\\\\\nMahomes, with his third Super Bowl MVP, now sits alongside Tom Brady (five) and Joe Montana (three) atop the mountain while becoming just the third player to win the award back-to-back, joining Bart Starr (I-II) and Terry Bradshaw (XIII-XIV).\\\\\\\\n The muffed punt that bounced off of cornerback Darrell Luter Jr.'s ankle was also the big break that the Chiefs needed as they scored on the very next play to take the lead for the first time in the game.
