AutoGen provides two types of built-in code\nexecutors, one is command line code executor, which runs code in a\ncommand line environment such as a UNIX shell, and the other is Jupyter\nexecutor, which runs code in an interactive\nJupyter\nkernel\n.\n\nFor each type of executor, AutoGen provides two ways to execute code:\nlocally and in a Docker container. One way is to execute code directly\nin the same host platform where AutoGen is running, i.e., the local\noperating system. It is for development and testing, but it is not ideal\nfor production as LLM can generate arbitrary code. The other way is to\nexecute code in a Docker container. The table below shows the\ncombinations of code executors and execution environments.\n\nIn this chapter, we will focus on the command line code executors.

The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\nif(n <= 0):\nreturn \"Input should be a positive integer.\"\nelif(n == 1):\nreturn 0\nelif(n == 2):\nreturn 1\nelse:\nfib = [0, 1]\nfor i in range(2, n):\nfib.append(fib[i-1] + fib[i-2])\nreturn fib[n-1]\nprint(fibonacci(14))\n```\nThis Python code defines a function `fibonacci(n)` which computes the n-th Fibonacci number. The function uses a list `fib` to store the Fibonacci numbers as they are computed, and then returns the (n-1)-th element as the n-th Fibonacci number due to zero-indexing in Python lists.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n>>>>>>>> NO HUMAN INPUT RECEIVED.\n>>>>>>>> USING AUTO REPLY...\n>>>>>>>> EXECUTING CODE BLOCK (inferred language is python)...\ncode_executor_agent\n(\nto\ncode_writer_agent\n)\n:\nexitcode: 0 (execution succeeded)\nCode output:\n233\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n>>>>>>>> USING AUTO REPLY...\ncode_writer_agent\n(\nto\ncode_executor_agent\n)\n:\nGreat, the execution was successful and the 14th Fibonacci number is 233.
