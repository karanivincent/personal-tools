You can use MemGPT to create perpetual chatbots that learn about you and modify their own personalities over time. You can connect MemGPT to your own local filesystems and databases, as well as connect MemGPT to your own tools and APIs. The MemGPT + AutoGen integration allows you to equip any AutoGen agent with MemGPT capabilities."
