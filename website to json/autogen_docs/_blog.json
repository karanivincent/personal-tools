To address this, we introduce Llama Guard as a custom agent in a 4-agents system.\n\nLlama Guard is designed to take both prompt and response as input for safety classification. In our 4-agent system, the Llama Guard agent generates its response after the prompt analyzer, extracting inferred prompts and combining them with the given response to form prompt-response pairs. These pairs are then passed to Llama Guard for safety inference.\n\nIf none of the prompt-response pairs are deemed unsafe by Llama Guard, the agent will respond that the given response is safe. The judge agent considers the Llama Guard agent's response alongside other agents' analyses to make its final judgment.\n\nAs shown in Table 4, introducing Llama Guard as a custom agent significantly reduces the False Positive Rate from 37.32% to 6.80% for the LLaMA-2-7b based defense, while keeping the ASR at a competitive level of 11.08%. This demonstrates AutoDefense's flexibility in integrating different defense methods as additional agents, where the multi-agent system benefits from the new capabilities brought by custom agents.\n\n"

After a few studies like\nEcoOptiGen\nand\nMathChat\n, in August, we published a\ntechnical report\nabout the multi-agent framework.\nIn October, we moved AutoGen from FLAML to a standalone repo on GitHub, and published an\nupdated technical report\n."

For example, there are many comments like the following on X (Twitter) or YouTube.\n\nAutogen gave me the same a-ha moment that I haven't felt since trying out GPT-3\nfor the first time.\n\nI have never been this surprised since ChatGPT.\n\nMany users have deep understanding of the value in different dimensions, such as the modularity, flexibility and simplicity.\n\nThe same reason autogen is significant is the same reason OOP is a good idea. Autogen packages up all that complexity into an agent I can create in one line, or modify with another.\n\nOver time, more and more users share their experiences in using or contributing to autogen.\n\nIn our Data Science department Autogen is helping us develop a production ready\nmulti-agents framework.\n\nSam Khalil, VP Data Insights & FounData, Novo Nordisk\n\nWhen I built an interactive learning tool for students, I looked for a tool that\ncould streamline the logistics but also give enough flexibility so I could use\ncustomized tools. AutoGen has both. It simplified the work. Thanks to Chi and his\nteam for sharing such a wonderful tool with the community.\n\nYongsheng Lian, Professor at the University of Louisville, Mechanical Engineering\n\nExciting news: the latest AutoGen release now features my contribution…\nThis experience has been a wonderful blend of learning and contributing,\ndemonstrating the dynamic and collaborative spirit of the tech community.\n\nDavor Runje, Cofounder @ airt / President of the board @ CISEx\n\nWith the support of a grant through the Data Intensive Studies Center at Tufts\nUniversity, our group is hoping to solve some of the challenges students face when\ntransitioning from undergraduate to graduate-level courses, particularly in Tufts'\nDoctor of Physical Therapy program in the School of Medicine. We're experimenting\nwith Autogen to create tailored assessments, individualized study guides, and focused\ntutoring. This approach has led to significantly better results than those we\nachieved using standard chatbots. With the help of Chi and his group at Microsoft,\nour current experiments include using multiple agents in sequential chat, teachable\nagents, and round-robin style debate formats. These methods have proven more\neffective in generating assessments and feedback compared to other large language\nmodels (LLMs) we've explored. I've also used OpenAI Assistant agents through Autogen\nin my Primary Care class to facilitate student engagement in patient interviews\nthrough digital simulations. The agent retrieved information from a real patient\nfeatured in a published case study, allowing students to practice their interview\nskills with realistic information.\n\nBenjamin D Stern, MS, DPT, Assistant Professor, Doctor of Physical Therapy Program,\nTufts University School of Medicine\n\nAutogen has been a game changer for how we analyze companies and products! Through\ncollaborative discourse between AI Agents we are able to shave days off our research\nand analysis process.\n\nJustin Trugman, Cofounder & Head of Technology at BetterFutureLabs\n\nThese are just a small fraction of examples. We have seen big enterprise customers’ interest from pretty much every vertical industry: Accounting, Airlines, Biotech, Consulting, Consumer Packaged Goods, Electronics, Entertainment, Finance, Fintech, Government, Healthcare, Manufacturer, Metals, Pharmacy, Research, Retailer, Social Media, Software, Supply Chain, Technology, Telecom…\n\nAutoGen is used or contributed by companies, organizations, universities from A to Z, in all over the world. We have seen hundreds of example applications. Some organization uses AutoGen as the backbone to build their agent platform. Others use AutoGen for diverse scenarios, including research and investment to novel and creative applications of multiple agents."

The transitions between states are controlled by heuristic rules or decisions made by the LLM, allowing for a dynamic and adaptive progression.\nUpon entering a state, a series of actions is executed, involving not only calling LLMs guided by different prompts, but also the utilization of external tools as needed."

Also, we define an error state to handle failures.\nIn the figure, execution outcomes are indicated by red arrows for failures and green for successes.\nTransition to different states is based on specific rules.

                    "text": "AutoGenBench is designed around three core design principles. Knowing these principles will help you understand the tool, its operation and its output. These three principles are:\n\nRepetition:\nLLMs are stochastic, and in many cases, so too is the code they write to solve problems. For example, a Python script might call an external search engine, and the results may vary run-to-run. This can lead to variance in agent performance. Repetition is key to measuring and understanding this variance. To this end, AutoGenBench is built from the ground up with an understanding that tasks may be run multiple times, and that variance is a metric we often want to measure.\n\nIsolation:\nAgents interact with their worlds in both subtle and overt ways. For example an agent may install a python library or write a file to disk. This can lead to ordering effects that can impact future measurements. Consider, for example, comparing two agents on a common benchmark. One agent may appear more efficient than the other simply because it ran second, and benefitted from the hard work the first agent did in installing and debugging necessary Python libraries. To address this, AutoGenBench isolates each task in its own Docker container. This ensures that all runs start with the same initial conditions. (Docker is also a\nmuch safer way to run agent-produced code\n, in general.)\n\nInstrumentation:\nWhile top-line metrics are great for comparing agents or models, we often want much more information about how the agents are performing, where they are getting stuck, and how they can be improved. We may also later think of new research questions that require computing a different set of metrics. To this end, AutoGenBench is designed to log everything, and to compute metrics from those logs. This ensures that one can always go back to the logs to answer questions about what happened, run profiling software, or feed the logs into tools like\nAgentEval\n."

However, if AutoGen runs outside of Docker, it's easy particularly for new users to overlook code-execution risks.\n\nAutoGen has now changed to by default execute any code inside a docker container (unless execution is already happening inside a docker container). It will launch a Docker image (either user-provided or default), execute the new code, and then terminate the image, preparing for the next code execution cycle.\n\nWe understand that not everyone is concerned about this especially when playing around with AutoGen for the first time. We have provided easy ways to turn this requirement off. But we believe that making sure that the user is aware of the fact that code will be executed locally, and prompting them to think about the security implications of running code locally is the right step for AutoGen."
