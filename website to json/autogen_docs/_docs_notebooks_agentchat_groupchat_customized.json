In\nthis work, we investigate the potential of large language models to generate\npatient summaries based on doctors' notes and study the effect of training data\non the faithfulness and quality of the generated summaries. To this end, we\ndevelop a rigorous labeling protocol for hallucinations, and have two medical\nexperts annotate 100 real-world summaries and 100 generated summaries. We show\nthat fine-tuning on hallucination-free data effectively reduces hallucinations\nfrom 2.60 to 1.55 per summary for Llama 2, while preserving relevant\ninformation. Although the effect is still present, it is much smaller for GPT-4\nwhen prompted with five examples (0.70 to 0.40). We also conduct a qualitative\nevaluation using hallucination-free and improved training data. GPT-4 shows\nvery good results even in the zero-shot setting. We find that common\nquantitative metrics do not correlate well with faithfulness and quality.\nFinally, we test GPT-4 for automatic hallucination detection, which yields\npromising results.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nScientist\n(\nto\nchat_manager\n)\n:\nBased on the abstract provided, the paper titled \"A Data-Centric Approach To Generate Faithful and High Quality Patient Summaries with Large Language Models\" explores the use of large language models, including GPT-4, to generate patient summaries from doctors' notes. The study focuses on the impact of training data on the faithfulness and quality of the generated summaries and also investigates the potential of GPT-4 for automatic hallucination detection.\n**Potential Applications in Software:**\n1. **Healthcare Documentation Automation:**\n- GPT-4 could be used to develop software that assists healthcare professionals in creating accurate and comprehensive patient summaries by automatically processing doctors' notes and other medical records.\n2. **Clinical Decision Support Systems:**\n- Integrating GPT-4 into clinical decision support systems could provide healthcare workers with insights and suggestions based on a patient's medical history, potentially improving diagnosis and treatment planning.\n3. **Patient Education and Communication:**\n- Software applications could leverage GPT-4 to translate complex medical information into patient-friendly summaries, enhancing patient understanding of their health conditions and treatments.\n4. **Medical Training and Simulation:**\n- GPT-4 could be used to create realistic medical scenarios for training medical students and professionals, simulating patient interactions and generating case studies.\n5. **Data Quality Assurance:**\n- The paper suggests that GPT-4 can be used for automatic hallucination detection, which refers to the identification of inaccuracies or fabrications in generated text. This could be applied to software that ensures the quality and reliability of medical documentation.\n6. **Research and Development:**\n- GPT-4 could assist researchers in summarizing and synthesizing large volumes of medical literature, aiding in the discovery of new insights and the development of novel treatments.\n7. **Personalized Health Monitoring:**\n- Software applications could use GPT-4 to provide personalized health monitoring and advice by analyzing user input, such as symptoms or lifestyle factors, and generating tailored health recommendations.\nThese potential applications highlight the versatility of GPT-4 in the realm of healthcare software, offering opportunities to enhance patient care, improve healthcare workflows, and support medical education and research.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAdmin\n(\nto\nchat_manager\n)\n:\nTERMINATE\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

We find that common\\nquantitative metrics do not correlate well with faithfulness and quality.\\nFinally, we test GPT-4 for automatic hallucination detection, which yields\\npromising results.\\n\", 'name': 'Executor', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': 'Based on the abstract provided, the paper titled \"A Data-Centric Approach To Generate Faithful and High Quality Patient Summaries with Large Language Models\" explores the use of large language models, including GPT-4, to generate patient summaries from doctors\\' notes. The study focuses on the impact of training data on the faithfulness and quality of the generated summaries and also investigates the potential of GPT-4 for automatic hallucination detection.\\n\\n**Potential Applications in Software:**\\n\\n1. **Healthcare Documentation Automation:**\\n   - GPT-4 could be used to develop software that assists healthcare professionals in creating accurate and comprehensive patient summaries by automatically processing doctors\\' notes and other medical records.\\n\\n2. **Clinical Decision Support Systems:**\\n   - Integrating GPT-4 into clinical decision support systems could provide healthcare workers with insights and suggestions based on a patient\\'s medical history, potentially improving diagnosis and treatment planning.\\n\\n3. **Patient Education and Communication:**\\n   - Software applications could leverage GPT-4 to translate complex medical information into patient-friendly summaries, enhancing patient understanding of their health conditions and treatments.\\n\\n4. **Medical Training and Simulation:**\\n   - GPT-4 could be used to create realistic medical scenarios for training medical students and professionals, simulating patient interactions and generating case studies.\\n\\n5. **Data Quality Assurance:**\\n   - The paper suggests that GPT-4 can be used for automatic hallucination detection, which refers to the identification of inaccuracies or fabrications in generated text. This could be applied to software that ensures the quality and reliability of medical documentation.\\n\\n6. **Research and Development:**\\n   - GPT-4 could assist researchers in summarizing and synthesizing large volumes of medical literature, aiding in the discovery of new insights and the development of novel treatments.\\n\\n7. **Personalized Health Monitoring:**\\n   - Software applications could use GPT-4 to provide personalized health monitoring and advice by analyzing user input, such as symptoms or lifestyle factors, and generating tailored health recommendations.\\n\\nThese potential applications highlight the versatility of GPT-4 in the realm of healthcare software, offering opportunities to enhance patient care, improve healthcare workflows, and support medical education and research.', 'name': 'Scientist', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': '\nTERMINATE\n', 'role': 'assistant'}], summary='', cost=({'total_cost': 0}, {'total_cost': 0}), human_input=['Approve', '\nTERMINATE\n'])"
