To address this, we introduce Llama Guard as a custom agent in a 4-agents system.\n\nLlama Guard is designed to take both prompt and response as input for safety classification. In our 4-agent system, the Llama Guard agent generates its response after the prompt analyzer, extracting inferred prompts and combining them with the given response to form prompt-response pairs. These pairs are then passed to Llama Guard for safety inference.\n\nIf none of the prompt-response pairs are deemed unsafe by Llama Guard, the agent will respond that the given response is safe. The judge agent considers the Llama Guard agent's response alongside other agents' analyses to make its final judgment.\n\nAs shown in Table 4, introducing Llama Guard as a custom agent significantly reduces the False Positive Rate from 37.32% to 6.80% for the LLaMA-2-7b based defense, while keeping the ASR at a competitive level of 11.08%. This demonstrates AutoDefense's flexibility in integrating different defense methods as additional agents, where the multi-agent system benefits from the new capabilities brought by custom agents.\n\n"
