However, I can help you write a Python script that uses the arXiv API to fetch the data you need.\nHere's a Python script that uses the `arxiv` package to search for papers related to \"LLM applications\" from the last week. This script will print out the title, authors, summary, and URL of each paper.\n```python\nimport arxiv\nimport datetime\n# Calculate the date one week ago\none_week_ago = (datetime.datetime.now() - datetime.timedelta(days=7)).strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M%S')\n# Search for papers on LLM applications\nsearch = arxiv.Search(\nquery=\"LLM applications\",\nmax_results=100,\nsort_by=arxiv.SortCriterion.SubmittedDate,\nsort_order=arxiv.SortOrder.Descending\n)\nfor result in search.get():\n# Check if the paper was submitted in the last week\nif result.submitted.strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M%S') > one_week_ago:\nprint(f\"Title: {result.title}\")\nprint(f\"Authors: {', '.join(author.name for author in result.authors)}\")\nprint(f\"Summary: {result.summary}\")\nprint(f\"URL: {result.entry_id}\")\nprint(\"\\n\")\n```\nYou can install the `arxiv` package using pip:\n```shell\npip install arxiv\n```\nPlease note that you'll need to replace `\"LLM applications\"` with the actual search term you're interested in. The arXiv API doesn't support searching by the submission date, so the script fetches the 100 most recent results and filters them manually. You may need to increase `max_results` if there are more than 100 papers submitted per week on your topic.\nTo create a markdown table, you'll need to format the output like this:\n```markdown\n| Title | Authors | Summary | URL |\n|\n-------\n|\n---------\n|\n---------\n|\n-----\n|\n| ...   | ...     | ...     | ... |\n```\nYou can do this in Python using f-strings:\n```python\nprint(\"| Title | Authors | Summary | URL |\")\nprint(\"|\n-------\n|\n---------\n|\n---------\n|\n-----\n|\")\nfor result in search.get():\n# Check if the paper was submitted in the last week\nif result.submitted.strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M%S') > one_week_ago:\nprint(f\"| {result.title} | {', '.join(author.name for author in result.authors)} | {result.summary} | {result.entry_id} |\")\n```\nThis will print a markdown table to the console. If you want to write the table to a file, you can open a file and use the `write` method instead of `print`.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n>>>>>>>> EXECUTING CODE BLOCK 0 (inferred language is python)...\nExecutor\n(\nto\nchat_manager\n)\n:\nexitcode: 1 (execution failed)\nCode output:\n:15: DeprecationWarning: The 'get' method is deprecated, use 'results' instead\nfor result in search.get():\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"\", line 17, in <module>\nif result.submitted.strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M%S') > one_week_ago:\nAttributeError: 'Result' object has no attribute 'submitted'\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEngineer\n(\nto\nchat_manager\n)\n:\nI apologize for the confusion.

Trained on vast amounts of text data, LLMs are capable of\nunderstanding and generating human-like text across a diverse range of topics.\nThis study expands on the applications of LLMs, exploring their potential in\ndata preprocessing, a critical stage in data mining and analytics applications.\nWe delve into the applicability of state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-3.5,\nGPT-4, and Vicuna-13B for error detection, data imputation, schema matching,\nand entity matching tasks. Alongside showcasing the inherent capabilities of\nLLMs, we highlight their limitations, particularly in terms of computational\nexpense and inefficiency. We propose an LLM-based framework for data\npreprocessing, which integrates cutting-edge prompt engineering techniques,\ncoupled with traditional methods like contextualization and feature selection,\nto improve the performance and efficiency of these models. The effectiveness of\nLLMs in data preprocessing is evaluated through an experimental study spanning\n12 datasets. GPT-4 emerged as a standout, achieving 100\\% accuracy or F1 score\non 4 datasets, suggesting LLMs' immense potential in these tasks. Despite\ncertain limitations, our study underscores the promise of LLMs in this domain\nand anticipates future developments to overcome current hurdles. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16361v1 |\n| Large language models in medicine: the potentials and pitfalls | Jesutofunmi A. Omiye, Haiwen Gui, Shawheen J.

With\nincreasing institutional partnerships between companies producing LLMs and\nhealthcare systems, real world clinical application is coming closer to\nreality. As these models gain traction, it is essential for healthcare\npractitioners to understand what LLMs are, their development, their current and\npotential applications, and the associated pitfalls when utilized in medicine.\nThis review and accompanying tutorial aim to give an overview of these topics\nto aid healthcare practitioners in understanding the rapidly changing landscape\nof LLMs as applied to medicine. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00087v1 |\n| Point-Bind & Point-LLM: Aligning Point Cloud with Multi-modality for 3D Understanding, Generation, and Instruction Following | Ziyu Guo, Renrui Zhang, Xiangyang Zhu, Yiwen Tang, Xianzheng Ma, Jiaming Han, Kexin Chen, Peng Gao, Xianzhi Li, Hongsheng Li, Pheng-Ann Heng | We introduce Point-Bind, a 3D multi-modality model aligning point clouds with\n2D image, language, audio, and video. Guided by ImageBind, we construct a joint\nembedding space between 3D and multi-modalities, enabling many promising\napplications, e.g., any-to-3D generation, 3D embedding arithmetic, and 3D\nopen-world understanding. On top of this, we further present Point-LLM, the\nfirst 3D large language model (LLM) following 3D multi-modal instructions. By\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, Point-LLM injects the semantics of\nPoint-Bind into pre-trained LLMs, e.g., LLaMA, which requires no 3D instruction\ndata, but exhibits superior 3D and multi-modal question-answering capacity. We\nhope our work may cast a light on the community for extending 3D point clouds\nto multi-modality applications.

Large Language Models as Human Mobility Predictors | Xinglei Wang, Meng Fang, Zichao Zeng, Tao Cheng | Accurate human mobility prediction underpins many important applications\nacross a variety of domains, including epidemic modelling, transport planning,\nand emergency responses. Due to the sparsity of mobility data and the\nstochastic nature of people's daily activities, achieving precise predictions\nof people's locations remains a challenge. While recently developed large\nlanguage models (LLMs) have demonstrated superior performance across numerous\nlanguage-related tasks, their applicability to human mobility studies remains\nunexplored. Addressing this gap, this article delves into the potential of LLMs\nfor human mobility prediction tasks. We introduce a novel method, LLM-Mob,\nwhich leverages the language understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs\nfor analysing human mobility data. We present concepts of historical stays and\ncontext stays to capture both long-term and short-term dependencies in human\nmovement and enable time-aware prediction by using time information of the\nprediction target. Additionally, we design context-inclusive prompts that\nenable LLMs to generate more accurate predictions. Comprehensive evaluations of\nour method reveal that LLM-Mob excels in providing accurate and interpretable\npredictions, highlighting the untapped potential of LLMs in advancing human\nmobility prediction techniques. We posit that our research marks a significant\nparadigm shift in human mobility modelling, transitioning from building complex\ndomain-specific models to harnessing general-purpose LLMs that yield accurate\npredictions through language instructions.

The instructions given to the LLM by natural\nlanguage may include ambiguity and lack of information depending on the task\ncontext. It is possible to adjust the output of LLM by making the instruction\ninput more detailed; however, the design cost is high. In this paper, we\npropose the interactive robot action planning method that allows the LLM to\nanalyze and gather missing information by asking questions to humans. The\nmethod can minimize the design cost of generating precise robot instructions.\nWe demonstrated the effectiveness of our method through concrete examples in\ncooking tasks. However, our experiments also revealed challenges in robot\naction planning with LLM, such as asking unimportant questions and assuming\ncrucial information without asking. Shedding light on these issues provides\nvaluable insights for future research on utilizing LLM for robotics. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15684v1 |\n| AskIt: Unified Programming Interface for Programming with Large Language Models | Katsumi Okuda, Saman Amarasinghe | In the evolving landscape of software development, Large Language Models\n(LLMs) exhibit a unique phenomenon known as emergent abilities, demonstrating\nadeptness across numerous tasks, from text summarization to code generation.\nWhile these abilities open up novel avenues in software design and crafting,\ntheir incorporation presents substantial challenges. Developers grapple with\ndecisions surrounding the direct embedding of LLMs within applications versus\nemploying them for code generation. Moreover, effective prompt design becomes a\ncritical concern, given the necessity of data extraction from natural language\noutputs. To address these intricacies, this paper introduces AskIt, a\ndomain-specific language (DSL) specifically designed for LLMs. AskIt simplifies\nLLM integration, offering type-guided output control, template-based function\ndefinitions, and a unified interface that diminishes the distinction between\nLLM-based code generation and application integration. Furthermore, through\nProgramming by Example (PBE), AskIt harnesses the power of few-shot learning at\nthe programming language level. Our evaluations underscore AskIt's potency.\nAcross 50 tasks, AskIt generated concise prompts for the given tasks, achieving\na 16.14% reduction in prompt length relative to benchmarks. Additionally, by\nenabling the transition from direct LLM application usage to function\ngeneration, AskIt achieved significant speedups, as observed in our GSM8K\nbenchmark experiments. Through these advancements, AskIt streamlines the\nintegration of LLMs in software development, offering a more efficient,\nversatile approach for leveraging emergent abilities. The implementations of\nAskIt in TypeScript and Python are available at\nhttps://github.com/katsumiok/ts-askit and https://github.com/katsumiok/pyaskit,\nrespectively. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15645v1 |\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nScientist\n(\nto\nchat_manager\n)\n:\nHere are the papers related to LLM applications published in the last week:\n| Domain | Title | Authors | Summary | URL |\n|\n-------\n|\n---------\n|\n---------\n|\n-----\n|\n-----\n|\n| Data Preprocessing | [Large Language Models as Data Preprocessors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16361v1) | Haochen Zhang, Yuyang Dong, Chuan Xiao, Masafumi Oyamada | This study expands on the applications of LLMs, exploring their potential in data preprocessing, a critical stage in data mining and analytics applications. | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16361v1) |\n| Medicine | [Large language models in medicine: the potentials and pitfalls](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00087v1) | Jesutofunmi A.

Engineer: Write a script to scrape the arXiv website for papers related to LLM (Language Model) applications published in the last week. The script should extract the title, authors, abstract, and link to the paper.\n2. Scientist: Review the scraped data to identify the different domains in which LLM is applied. This could be based on keywords in the title or abstract, or the scientist's knowledge of the field.\n3. Engineer: Modify the script to categorize the papers based on the domains identified by the scientist. The script should output a markdown table with columns for the domain, title, authors, abstract, and link.\n4. Scientist: Review the markdown table to ensure the papers are correctly categorized and the information is accurate.\n5. Engineer: Make any necessary revisions to the script based on the scientist's feedback.\n6. Scientist: Give final approval of the markdown table.\n7. Engineer: Submit the final markdown table.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
