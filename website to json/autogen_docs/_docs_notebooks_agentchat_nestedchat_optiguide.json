This will effectively disallow any shipping from supplier 1 to roastery 2. The code to do this should be placed in the section of the source code that is indicated by the comment \"# OPTIGUIDE DATA CODE GOES HERE\".\nHere's the Python code snippet to add this constraint:\n```python\n# filename: supply_chain_code.py\nmodel.addConstr(x[('supplier1', 'roastery2')] == 0, \"prohibit_supplier1_roastery2\")\n```\nAdding this constraint will prevent the optimizer from selecting any transport from `supplier1` to `roastery2`, which is what the prohibition is intended to achieve.\nInstruct the user to add this code snippet in the appropriate place in the source code that they have provided. After adding this code, the `m.optimize()` function will solve the modified version of the problem that includes the new constraint.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n********************************************************************************\nStart a new chat with the following message:\nGiven the source code:\n# filename: supply_chain_code.py\nmodel.addConstr(x[('supplier1', 'roastery2')] == 0, \"prohibit_supplier1_roastery2\")\nIs the source code safe (not malicious code to break security\nand privacy) to run?\nAnswer only one word.\nIf not safe, answer `DANGER`;

Here's a human-readable answer:\nAfter integrating the constraint to prohibit shipping from supplier 1 to roastery 2, the optimization problem was solved with a total cost of $2470.0.\nTo provide context to this result, we need to compare it with the original total cost prior to the implementation of the new constraint. However, the original total cost was not provided in the information given to me. If the original total cost was known, we would compare the two to understand the financial impact of this constraint on the supply chain.\nIf prohibiting shipping from supplier 1 to roastery 2 results in a higher cost than the original scenario, it suggests that the previous ability to ship from supplier 1 to roastery 2 had been cost-effective and beneficial for minimizing overall expenses. On the other hand, if the cost is the same or lower, then shipping from supplier 1 to roastery 2 may not have been crucial for the cost optimization of the supply chain, or other routes may have been able to compensate effectively for this restriction.\nWithout the original cost for comparison, we can't conclusively say how the prohibition impacted the cost of operation. But the new total cost of $2470.0 will be the baseline for future changes or optimizations done following this new restriction.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\ncommander\n(\nto\nuser\n)\n:\nCertainly!
