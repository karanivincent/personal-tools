As sunlight reaches Earth's atmosphere, it interacts with molecules and particles in the air, causing the scattering of light. Blue light has a shorter wavelength and gets scattered more easily than other colors, which is why the sky appears blue during a clear day.\nHowever, during sunrise and sunset, the sky can appear red, orange, or purple due to a different type of scattering called scattering by dust, pollutants, and water droplets, which scatter longer wavelengths of light more effectively.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nProvide feedback to agent.

This additional distance results in more scattering of sunlight, which preferentially scatters the longer wavelengths (red, orange, and yellow) more than the shorter wavelengths (blue and green).\nThe scattering of sunlight by the Earth's atmosphere causes the red, orange, and yellow colors to be more prevalent in the sky during sunrise and sunset, resulting in the beautiful display of colors often referred to as a sunrise or sunset.\nAs the sun continues to set, the sky can transition to various shades of purple, pink, and eventually dark blue or black, as the available sunlight continues to decrease and the longer wavelengths are progressively scattered less effectively.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nProvide feedback to agent.
