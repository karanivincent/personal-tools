You can do so by running the following command in your shell.\n```sh\npip install matplotlib\n```\nOnce installed, you can execute the following code to generate the scatter plot and save it as `graph.png`.\n```python\n# filename: plot_google_products.py\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Data for plotting\nproducts = ['Google Search', 'Gmail', 'Google Maps', 'YouTube',\n'Google Chrome', 'Android', 'Google Drive', 'Google Home', 'Google Stadia']\nrelease_years = [1998, 2004, 2005, 2005, 2008, 2008, 2012, 2016, 2019]\n# Placing the products on the y-axis and years on the x-axis\ny_positions = range(len(products))\n# Creating the scatter plot\nplt.scatter(release_years, y_positions)\nplt.yticks(y_positions, products)\n# Adding title and labels\nplt.title('Release Years of Google Products')\nplt.xlabel('Year')\nplt.ylabel('Product')\n# Saving the plot\nplt.savefig('graph.png')\n# Show the plot for verification (this is optional and can be removed if only the file is needed)\nplt.show()\n```\nAfter you have executed the above script, `graph.png` will be saved in your current directory. Please run this code in your Python environment, and then you should find the `graph.png` file with the scatter plot of Google products and their release years.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n>>>>>>>> EXECUTING CODE BLOCK 0 (inferred language is sh)...\n>>>>>>>> EXECUTING CODE BLOCK 1 (inferred language is python)...\nuser_proxy\n(\nto\nchat_manager\n)\n:\nexitcode: 0 (execution succeeded)\nCode output:\nRequirement already satisfied: matplotlib in /home/beibinli/anaconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages (3.7.1)\nRequirement already satisfied: contourpy>=1.0.1 in /home/beibinli/anaconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages (from matplotlib) (1.0.5)\nRequirement already satisfied: cycler>=0.10 in /home/beibinli/anaconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages (from matplotlib) (0.11.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: fonttools>=4.22.0 in /home/beibinli/anaconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages (from matplotlib) (4.25.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: kiwisolver>=1.0.1 in /home/beibinli/anaconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages (from matplotlib) (1.4.4)\nRequirement already satisfied: numpy>=1.20 in /home/beibinli/anaconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages (from matplotlib) (1.24.4)\nRequirement already satisfied: packaging>=20.0 in /home/beibinli/anaconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages (from matplotlib) (23.2)\nRequirement already satisfied: pillow>=6.2.0 in /home/beibinli/anaconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages (from matplotlib) (10.1.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: pyparsing>=2.3.1 in /home/beibinli/anaconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages (from matplotlib) (3.0.9)\nRequirement already satisfied: python-dateutil>=2.7 in /home/beibinli/anaconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages (from matplotlib) (2.8.2)\nRequirement already satisfied: importlib-resources>=3.2.0 in /home/beibinli/anaconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages (from matplotlib) (5.13.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: zipp>=3.1.0 in /home/beibinli/anaconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages (from importlib-resources>=3.2.0->matplotlib) (3.11.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: six>=1.5 in /home/beibinli/anaconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages (from python-dateutil>=2.7->matplotlib) (1.16.0)\nFigure(640x480)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
