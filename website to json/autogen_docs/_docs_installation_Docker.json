Docker allows you to create consistent environments that are portable and isolated from the host OS. With Docker, everything AutoGen needs to run, from the operating system to specific libraries, is encapsulated in a container, ensuring uniform functionality across different systems. The Dockerfiles necessary for AutoGen are conveniently located in the project's GitHub repository at\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/autogen/tree/main/.devcontainer\n.\n\nPre-configured DockerFiles\n: The AutoGen Project offers pre-configured Dockerfiles for your use. These Dockerfiles will run as is, however they can be modified to suit your development needs. Please see the README.md file in autogen/.devcontainer"
