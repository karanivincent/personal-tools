GPT-4 is currently the state of the art LLM in the world. Is model selection irrelevant? What about inference parameters?\n\nIn this blog post, we will explore how model and inference parameter matter in LLM applications, using a case study for\nMATH\n, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on advanced mathematical problem solving. MATH consists of 12K math competition problems from AMC-10, AMC-12 and AIME. Each problem is accompanied by a step-by-step solution.\n\nWe will use AutoGen to automatically find the best model and inference parameter for LLMs on a given task and dataset given an inference budget, using a novel low-cost search & pruning strategy. AutoGen currently supports all the LLMs from OpenAI, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.\n\nWe will use AutoGen to perform model selection and inference parameter tuning. Then we compare the performance and inference cost on solving algebra problems with the untuned gpt-4. We will also analyze how different difficulty levels affect the results."

We use the following inference parameters:\n\nIn this experiment, when n > 1, we find the answer with highest votes among all the responses and then select it as the final answer to compare with the ground truth. For example, if n = 5 and 3 of the responses contain a final answer 301 while 2 of the responses contain a final answer 159, we choose 301 as the final answer. This can help with resolving potential errors due to randomness. We use the average accuracy and average inference cost as the metric to evaluate the performance over a dataset. The inference cost of a particular instance is measured by the price per 1K tokens and the number of tokens consumed."

The tuned gpt-4 achieves much higher accuracy (56% vs. 44%) and lower cost than the untuned gpt-4.\nOn level 5 the result is similar.\n\n\n\nWe can see that AutoGen has found different optimal model and inference parameters for each subset of a particular level, which shows that these parameters matter in cost-sensitive LLM applications and need to be carefully tuned or adapted.\n\nAn example notebook to run these experiments can be found at:\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/v1.2.1/notebook/autogen_chatgpt.ipynb\n. The experiments were run when AutoGen was a subpackage in FLAML."

In general, through parameter tuning and model selection, we can identify the opportunity to save the expensive model for more challenging tasks, and improve the overall effectiveness of a budget-constrained system.\n\nThere are many other alternative ways of solving math problems, which we have not covered in this blog post. When there are choices beyond the inference parameters, they can be generally tuned via\nflaml.tune\n.\n\nThe need for model selection, parameter tuning and cost saving is not specific to the math problems. The\nAuto-GPT\nproject is an example where high cost can easily prevent a generic complex task to be accomplished as it needs many LLM inference calls."
