This abstraction\nnot only allows agents to model real-world and abstract entities, such\nas people and algorithms, but it also simplifies implementation of\ncomplex workflows as collaboration among agents.\n\nFurther, AutoGen is extensible and composable: you can extend a simple\nagent with customizable components and create workflows that can combine\nthese agents and power a more sophisticated agent, resulting in\nimplementations that are modular and easy to maintain.\n\nMost importantly, AutoGen is developed by a vibrant community of\nresearchers and engineers. It incorporates the latest research in\nmulti-agent systems and has been used in many real-world applications,\nincluding agent platform, advertising, AI employees, blog/article\nwriting, blockchain, calculate burned areas by wildfires, customer\nsupport, cybersecurity, data analytics, debate, education, finance,\ngaming, legal consultation, research, robotics, sales/marketing, social\nsimulation, software engineering, software security, supply chain,\nt-shirt design, training data generation, Youtube service…"

For example,\nwhen the task is completed, or perhaps when the process has consumed\nenough resources and needs to either stop or adopt different strategies,\nsuch as user intervention. So AutoGen natively supports several\nmechanisms to terminate conversations.\n\nHow to Control Termination with AutoGen? Currently there are two broad\nmechanism to control the termination of conversations between agents:\n\nSpecify parameters in\ninitiate_chat\n: When initiating a chat,\nyou can define parameters that determine when the conversation\nshould end.\n\nConfigure an agent to trigger termination\n: When defining\nindividual agents, you can specify parameters that allow agents to\nterminate of a conversation based on particular (configurable)\nconditions."

One way is to execute code directly\nin the same host platform where AutoGen is running, i.e., the local\noperating system. It is for development and testing, but it is not ideal\nfor production as LLM can generate arbitrary code. The other way is to\nexecute code in a Docker container.

When you need to collect info, use the code to output the info you need, for example, browse or search the web, download/read a file, print the content of a webpage or a file, get the current date/time, check the operating system. After sufficient info is printed and the task is ready to be solved based on your language skill, you can solve the task by yourself.\n2. When you need to perform some task with code, use the code to perform the task and output the result. Finish the task smartly.\nSolve the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. Be clear which step uses code, and which step uses your language skill.\nWhen using code, you must indicate the script type in the code block. The user cannot provide any other feedback or perform any other action beyond executing the code you suggest. The user can't modify your code. So do not suggest incomplete code which requires users to modify. Don't use a code block if it's not intended to be executed by the user.\nIf you want the user to save the code in a file before executing it, put # filename: <filename> inside the code block as the first line. Don't include multiple code blocks in one response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant. Check the execution result returned by the user.\nIf the result indicates there is an error, fix the error and output the code again. Suggest the full code instead of partial code or code changes. If the error can't be fixed or if the task is not solved even after the code is executed successfully, analyze the problem, revisit your assumption, collect additional info you need, and think of a different approach to try.\nWhen you find an answer, verify the answer carefully.

The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\nif(n <= 0):\nreturn \"Input should be a positive integer.\"\nelif(n == 1):\nreturn 0\nelif(n == 2):\nreturn 1\nelse:\nfib = [0, 1]\nfor i in range(2, n):\nfib.append(fib[i-1] + fib[i-2])\nreturn fib[n-1]\nprint(fibonacci(14))\n```\nThis Python code defines a function `fibonacci(n)` which computes the n-th Fibonacci number. The function uses a list `fib` to store the Fibonacci numbers as they are computed, and then returns the (n-1)-th element as the n-th Fibonacci number due to zero-indexing in Python lists.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n>>>>>>>> NO HUMAN INPUT RECEIVED.\n>>>>>>>> USING AUTO REPLY...\n>>>>>>>> EXECUTING CODE BLOCK (inferred language is python)...\ncode_executor_agent\n(\nto\ncode_writer_agent\n)\n:\nexitcode: 0 (execution succeeded)\nCode output:\n233\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n>>>>>>>> USING AUTO REPLY...\ncode_writer_agent\n(\nto\ncode_executor_agent\n)\n:\nGreat, the execution was successful and the 14th Fibonacci number is 233.

The sender agent uses its chat initializer method (i.e.,\ngenerate_init_message\nmethod of\nConversableAgent\n) to generate an\ninitial message from the inputs, and sends it to the recipient agent to\nstart the chat. The sender agent is the agent whose\ninitiate_chat\nmethod is called, and the recipient agent is the other agent.\n\nOnce the chat terminates, the history of the chat is processed by a chat\nsummarizer. The summarizer summarizes the chat history and calculates\nthe token usage of the chat. You can configure the type of summary using\nthe\nsummary_method\nparameter of the\ninitiate_chat\nmethod. By\ndefault, it is the last message of the chat (i.e.,\nsummary_method='last_msg'\n).\n\nThe example below is a two-agent chat between a student agent and a\nteacher agent.

Here's an example:\nSuppose you're given three line segments with lengths 10, 7, and 3 units.

Adding any two side lengths together should be greater than the third:\n- For sides 10 and 7: 10 + 7 = 17, which is larger than 3.\n- For sides 10 and 3: 10 + 3 = 13, which is larger than 7.\n- For sides 7 and 3: 7 + 3 = 10, which is equal to the length of the third side (10), but not greater.\nSo, these three lines cannot form a triangle, because not all pairs of sides satisfy the triangle inequality theorem.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

This is useful\nfor tasks that require collaboration among multiple agents.\n\nThe figure below illustrates how group chat works.\n\n\n\nA group chat is orchestrated by a special agent type\nGroupChatManager\n.\nIn the first step of the group chat, the Group Chat Manager selects an\nagent to speak. Then, the selected agent speaks and the message is sent\nback to the Group Chat Manager, who\nbroadcasts\nthe message to all\nother agents in the group. This process repeats until the conversation\nstops.\n\nThe Group Chat Manager can use several strategies to select the next\nagent. Currently, the following strategies are supported:\n\nTo illustrate this pattern, let’s consider a simple example of a group\nchat among the same arithmetic operator agents as in the previous\nexample, with the objective of turning a number into a specific target\nnumber using a sequence of arithmetic operations powered by the agents.\n\nIn this example, we use the\nauto\nstrategy to select the next agent. To\nhelp the Group Chat Manager select the next agent, we also set the\ndescription\nof the agents.

In\nsome other cases, it is also useful to package a workflow into a single\nagent for reuse in a larger workflow. AutoGen provides a way to achieve\nthis by using nested chats.\n\nNested chats is powered by the nested chats handler, which is a\npluggable component of\nConversableAgent\n. The figure below illustrates\nhow the nested chats handler triggers a sequence of nested chats when a\nmessage is received.\n\n\n\nWhen a message comes in and passes the\nhuman-in-the-loop\ncomponent\n, the nested chats handler checks if the\nmessage should trigger a nested chat based on conditions specified by\nthe user. If the conditions are met, the nested chats handler starts a\nsequence of nested chats specified using the sequential chats pattern.\nIn each of the nested chats, the sender agent is always the same agent\nthat triggered the nested chats. In the end, the nested chat handler\nuses the results of the nested chats to produce a response to the\noriginal message. By default, the nested chat handler uses the summary\nof the last chat as the response.\n\nHere is an example of using nested chats to build an arithmetic agent\nthat packages arithmetic operations, code-based validation, and poetry\ninto a single agent. This arithmetic agent takes a number transformation\nrequest like “turn number 3 into 13” and returns a poem that describes a\ntransformation attempt.\n\nFirst we define the agents. We reuse the\ngroup_chat_manager_with_intros\nfrom previous example to orchestrate\nthe arithmetic operations."

This can be achieved by optimizing the hyperparameters of the inference,\nwhich can significantly affect both the utility and the cost of the generated text.\n\nThe tunable hyperparameters include:\n\nThe cost and utility of text generation are intertwined with the joint effect of these hyperparameters.\nThere are also complex interactions among subsets of the hyperparameters. For example,\nthe temperature and top_p are not recommended to be altered from their default values together because they both control the randomness of the generated text, and changing both at the same time can result in conflicting effects; n and best_of are rarely tuned together because if the application can process multiple outputs, filtering on the server side causes unnecessary information loss; both n and max_tokens will affect the total number of tokens generated, which in turn will affect the cost of the request.\nThese interactions and trade-offs make it difficult to manually determine the optimal hyperparameter settings for a given text generation task.\n\nDo the choices matter?

Fetch market cap information for these companies using yfinance.\n3. Clean and process the fetched data into a usable format (a pandas DataFrame).\n4.

Before I continue, I need to know if the necessary libraries are installed.\nThe libraries needed for this task are:\n1. `yfinance`\n2. `pandas`\n3. `matplotlib`\nIf these libraries are not installed, you can install them using pip:\n```python\n!pip install yfinance pandas matplotlib\n```\nAssuming these libraries are installed, we would import them and proceed with fetching the market cap data:\n```python\nimport yfinance as yf\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Define tickers\ntickers = [\"AAPL\", \"MSFT\", \"GOOGL\", \"AMZN\", \"FB\", \"TSLA\", \"BRK-A\"]\n# Fetch data\ndata = yf.download(tickers, start=\"2022-02-01\", end=\"2022-02-28\")\n# Extract only 'Close' values for each ticker\ndata = data['Close']\n# Create empty dictionary to hold market cap data\nmarket_caps = {}\n# Calculate market caps\nfor ticker in tickers:\ninfo = yf.Ticker(ticker).info\nmarket_caps[ticker] = info[\"marketCap\"]\n# Convert market_caps dictionary to pandas DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame(list(market_caps.items()), columns=['Company', 'Market_Cap'])\n# Sort DataFrame by Market_Cap in descending order\ndf = df.sort_values('Market_Cap', ascending=False)\n# Plot data\nplt.figure(figsize=(10,6))\nplt.barh(df['Company'], df['Market_Cap'], color='skyblue')\nplt.xlabel('Market Cap (in trillions)')\nplt.title('Market Caps of Top 7 Publicly Listed Companies')\nplt.gca().invert_yaxis()\nplt.show()\n```\nPlease note that the start and end dates used while fetching data specifies the time period we are interested in. Feel free to modify these as needed. The 'marketCap' obtained from the 'info' property of the Ticker object represents the market cap as of the end date.\nAlso note that the final plot shows the companies in descending order of market cap, with the company with the highest market cap at the top of the chart.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n>>>>>>>> USING AUTO REPLY...\n>>>>>>>> EXECUTING 2 CODE BLOCKS (inferred languages are [python, python])...\nCodeExecutor\n(\nto\nCodeWriter\n)\n:\nexitcode: 0 (execution succeeded)\nCode output: Requirement already satisfied: yfinance in /Users/ekzhu/miniconda3/envs/autogen/lib/python3.11/site-packages (0.2.36)\nRequirement already satisfied: pandas in /Users/ekzhu/miniconda3/envs/autogen/lib/python3.11/site-packages (2.2.1)\nRequirement already satisfied: matplotlib in /Users/ekzhu/miniconda3/envs/autogen/lib/python3.11/site-packages (3.8.3)\nRequirement already satisfied: numpy>=1.16.5 in /Users/ekzhu/miniconda3/envs/autogen/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from yfinance) (1.26.4)\nRequirement already satisfied: requests>=2.31 in /Users/ekzhu/miniconda3/envs/autogen/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from yfinance) (2.31.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: multitasking>=0.0.7 in /Users/ekzhu/miniconda3/envs/autogen/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from yfinance) (0.0.11)\nRequirement already satisfied: lxml>=4.9.1 in /Users/ekzhu/miniconda3/envs/autogen/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from yfinance) (5.0.1)\nRequirement already satisfied: appdirs>=1.4.4 in /Users/ekzhu/miniconda3/envs/autogen/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from yfinance) (1.4.4)\nRequirement already satisfied: pytz>=2022.5 in /Users/ekzhu/miniconda3/envs/autogen/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from yfinance) (2023.3.post1)\nRequirement already satisfied: frozendict>=2.3.4 in /Users/ekzhu/miniconda3/envs/autogen/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from yfinance) (2.4.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: peewee>=3.16.2 in /Users/ekzhu/miniconda3/envs/autogen/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from yfinance) (3.17.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: beautifulsoup4>=4.11.1 in /Users/ekzhu/miniconda3/envs/autogen/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from yfinance) (4.12.2)\nRequirement already satisfied: html5lib>=1.1 in /Users/ekzhu/miniconda3/envs/autogen/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from yfinance) (1.1)\nRequirement already satisfied: python-dateutil>=2.8.2 in /Users/ekzhu/miniconda3/envs/autogen/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from pandas) (2.8.2)\nRequirement already satisfied: tzdata>=2022.7 in /Users/ekzhu/miniconda3/envs/autogen/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from pandas) (2023.4)\nRequirement already satisfied: contourpy>=1.0.1 in /Users/ekzhu/miniconda3/envs/autogen/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from matplotlib) (1.2.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: cycler>=0.10 in /Users/ekzhu/miniconda3/envs/autogen/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from matplotlib) (0.12.1)\nRequirement already satisfied: fonttools>=4.22.0 in /Users/ekzhu/miniconda3/envs/autogen/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from matplotlib) (4.47.2)\nRequirement already satisfied: kiwisolver>=1.3.1 in /Users/ekzhu/miniconda3/envs/autogen/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from matplotlib) (1.4.5)\nRequirement already satisfied: packaging>=20.0 in /Users/ekzhu/miniconda3/envs/autogen/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from matplotlib) (23.2)\nRequirement already satisfied: pillow>=8 in /Users/ekzhu/miniconda3/envs/autogen/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from matplotlib) (10.2.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: pyparsing>=2.3.1 in /Users/ekzhu/miniconda3/envs/autogen/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from matplotlib) (3.1.1)\nRequirement already satisfied: soupsieve>1.2 in /Users/ekzhu/miniconda3/envs/autogen/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from beautifulsoup4>=4.11.1->yfinance) (2.5)\nRequirement already satisfied: six>=1.9 in /Users/ekzhu/miniconda3/envs/autogen/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from html5lib>=1.1->yfinance) (1.16.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: webencodings in /Users/ekzhu/miniconda3/envs/autogen/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from html5lib>=1.1->yfinance) (0.5.1)\nRequirement already satisfied: charset-normalizer<4,>=2 in /Users/ekzhu/miniconda3/envs/autogen/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from requests>=2.31->yfinance) (3.3.2)\nRequirement already satisfied: idna<4,>=2.5 in /Users/ekzhu/miniconda3/envs/autogen/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from requests>=2.31->yfinance) (3.6)\nRequirement already satisfied: urllib3<3,>=1.21.1 in /Users/ekzhu/miniconda3/envs/autogen/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from requests>=2.31->yfinance) (1.26.18)\nRequirement already satisfied: certifi>=2017.4.17 in /Users/ekzhu/miniconda3/envs/autogen/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from requests>=2.31->yfinance) (2024.2.2)\n/Users/ekzhu/miniconda3/envs/autogen/lib/python3.11/site-packages/yfinance/utils.py:775: FutureWarning: The 'unit' keyword in TimedeltaIndex construction is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.

This simplifies development by allowing you to focus on adding new messages rather than managing conversation flow.\n\nFile Access and Integration:  Enable agents to access and utilize files in various formats. Files can be incorporated during agent creation or throughout conversations via threads. Additionally, agents can generate files (e.g., images, spreadsheets) and cite referenced files within their responses.\n\nFor a practical illustration, here are some examples:"

With the rise of prompt-based\nservices, such as prompt marketplaces and LLM applications, providers often\ndisplay prompts' capabilities through input-output examples to attract users.\nHowever, this paradigm raises a pivotal security concern: does the exposure of\ninput-output pairs pose the risk of potential prompt leakage, infringing on the\nintellectual property rights of the developers? To our knowledge, this problem\nstill has not been comprehensively explored yet. To remedy this gap, in this\npaper, we perform the first in depth exploration and propose a novel attack\nframework for reverse-stealing prompts against commercial LLMs, namely PRSA.\nThe main idea of PRSA is that by analyzing the critical features of the\ninput-output pairs, we mimic and gradually infer (steal) the target prompts. In\ndetail, PRSA mainly consists of two key phases: prompt mutation and prompt\npruning. In the mutation phase, we propose a prompt attention algorithm based\non differential feedback to capture these critical features for effectively\ninferring the target prompts. In the prompt pruning phase, we identify and mask\nthe words dependent on specific inputs, enabling the prompts to accommodate\ndiverse inputs for generalization. Through extensive evaluation, we verify that\nPRSA poses a severe threat in real world scenarios.

Towards More Meaningful Evaluations\nfor Values and Opinions in Large Language Models\nAuthors: Paul Röttger, Valentin Hofmann, Valentina Pyatkin, Musashi Hinck, Hannah Rose Kirk, Hinrich Schütze, Dirk Hovy\nAbstract: Much recent work seeks to evaluate values and opinions in large language\nmodels (LLMs) using multiple-choice surveys and questionnaires. Most of this\nwork is motivated by concerns around real-world LLM applications. For example,\npolitically-biased LLMs may subtly influence society when they are used by\nmillions of people. Such real-world concerns, however, stand in stark contrast\nto the artificiality of current evaluations: real users do not typically ask\nLLMs survey questions. Motivated by this discrepancy, we challenge the\nprevailing constrained evaluation paradigm for values and opinions in LLMs and\nexplore more realistic unconstrained evaluations. As a case study, we focus on\nthe popular Political Compass Test (PCT). In a systematic review, we find that\nmost prior work using the PCT forces models to comply with the PCT's\nmultiple-choice format. We show that models give substantively different\nanswers when not forced; that answers change depending on how models are\nforced; and that answers lack paraphrase robustness. Then, we demonstrate that\nmodels give different answers yet again in a more realistic open-ended answer\nsetting. We distill these findings into recommendations and open challenges in\nevaluating values and opinions in LLMs.\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16786v1\nTitle: Large Language Models as Urban Residents: An LLM Agent Framework for\nPersonal Mobility Generation\nAuthors: Jiawei Wang, Renhe Jiang, Chuang Yang, Zengqing Wu, Makoto Onizuka, Ryosuke Shibasaki, Chuan Xiao\nAbstract: This paper introduces a novel approach using Large Language Models (LLMs)\nintegrated into an agent framework for flexible and efficient personal mobility\ngeneration. LLMs overcome the limitations of previous models by efficiently\nprocessing semantic data and offering versatility in modeling various tasks.\nOur approach addresses the critical need to align LLMs with real-world urban\nmobility data, focusing on three research questions: aligning LLMs with rich\nactivity data, developing reliable activity generation strategies, and\nexploring LLM applications in urban mobility. The key technical contribution is\na novel LLM agent framework that accounts for individual activity patterns and\nmotivations, including a self-consistency approach to align LLMs with\nreal-world activity data and a retrieval-augmented strategy for interpretable\nactivity generation. In experimental studies, comprehensive validation is\nperformed using real-world data. This research marks the pioneering work of\ndesigning an LLM agent framework for activity generation based on real-world\nhuman activity data, offering a promising tool for urban mobility analysis.\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14744v1\nTitle: An Evaluation of Large Language Models in Bioinformatics Research\nAuthors: Hengchuang Yin, Zhonghui Gu, Fanhao Wang, Yiparemu Abuduhaibaier, Yanqiao Zhu, Xinming Tu, Xian-Sheng Hua, Xiao Luo, Yizhou Sun\nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have gained considerable\ninterest across diverse research communities.

These instructions, which potentially contain sensitive\ninformation, are annotated by human workers in the process. This poses a new\nprivacy risk not addressed by the typical private optimization. To this end, we\npropose using synthetic instructions to replace real instructions in data\nannotation and model fine-tuning. Formal differential privacy is guaranteed by\ngenerating those synthetic instructions using privately fine-tuned generators.\nCrucial in achieving the desired utility is our novel filtering algorithm that\nmatches the distribution of the synthetic instructions to that of the real\nones. In both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human\nfeedback, our extensive experiments demonstrate the high utility of the final\nset of synthetic instructions by showing comparable results to real\ninstructions. In supervised fine-tuning, models trained with private synthetic\ninstructions outperform leading open-source models such as Vicuna.\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13659v1\nTitle: Ain't Misbehavin' -- Using LLMs to Generate Expressive Robot Behavior in\nConversations with the Tabletop Robot Haru\nAuthors: Zining Wang, Paul Reisert, Eric Nichols, Randy Gomez\nAbstract: Social robots aim to establish long-term bonds with humans through engaging\nconversation. However, traditional conversational approaches, reliant on\nscripted interactions, often fall short in maintaining engaging conversations.\nThis paper addresses this limitation by integrating large language models\n(LLMs) into social robots to achieve more dynamic and expressive conversations.\nWe introduce a fully-automated conversation system that leverages LLMs to\ngenerate robot responses with expressive behaviors, congruent with the robot's\npersonality. We incorporate robot behavior with two modalities: 1) a\ntext-to-speech (TTS) engine capable of various delivery styles, and 2) a\nlibrary of physical actions for the robot. We develop a custom,\nstate-of-the-art emotion recognition model to dynamically select the robot's\ntone of voice and utilize emojis from LLM output as cues for generating robot\nactions. A demo of our system is available here. To illuminate design and\nimplementation issues, we conduct a pilot study where volunteers chat with a\nsocial robot using our proposed system, and we analyze their feedback,\nconducting a rigorous error analysis of chat transcripts. Feedback was\noverwhelmingly positive, with participants commenting on the robot's empathy,\nhelpfulness, naturalness, and entertainment. Most negative feedback was due to\nautomatic speech recognition (ASR) errors which had limited impact on\nconversations. However, we observed a small class of errors, such as the LLM\nrepeating itself or hallucinating fictitious information and human responses,\nthat have the potential to derail conversations, raising important issues for\nLLM application.\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11571v1\nTitle: Fine-tuning Large Language Model (LLM) Artificial Intelligence Chatbots\nin Ophthalmology and LLM-based evaluation using GPT-4\nAuthors: Ting Fang Tan, Kabilan Elangovan, Liyuan Jin, Yao Jie, Li Yong, Joshua Lim, Stanley Poh, Wei Yan Ng, Daniel Lim, Yuhe Ke, Nan Liu, Daniel Shu Wei Ting\nAbstract: Purpose: To assess the alignment of GPT-4-based evaluation to human clinician\nexperts, for the evaluation of responses to ophthalmology-related patient\nqueries generated by fine-tuned LLM chatbots. Methods: 400 ophthalmology\nquestions and paired answers were created by ophthalmologists to represent\ncommonly asked patient questions, divided into fine-tuning (368; 92%), and\ntesting (40; 8%). We find-tuned 5 different LLMs, including LLAMA2-7b,\nLLAMA2-7b-Chat, LLAMA2-13b, and LLAMA2-13b-Chat. For the testing dataset,\nadditional 8 glaucoma QnA pairs were included. 200 responses to the testing\ndataset were generated by 5 fine-tuned LLMs for evaluation. A customized\nclinical evaluation rubric was used to guide GPT-4 evaluation, grounded on\nclinical accuracy, relevance, patient safety, and ease of understanding. GPT-4\nevaluation was then compared against ranking by 5 clinicians for clinical\nalignment. Results: Among all fine-tuned LLMs, GPT-3.5 scored the highest\n(87.1%), followed by LLAMA2-13b (80.9%), LLAMA2-13b-chat (75.5%),\nLLAMA2-7b-Chat (70%) and LLAMA2-7b (68.8%) based on the GPT-4 evaluation. GPT-4\nevaluation demonstrated significant agreement with human clinician rankings,\nwith Spearman and Kendall Tau correlation coefficients of 0.90 and 0.80\nrespectively; while correlation based on Cohen Kappa was more modest at 0.50.\nNotably, qualitative analysis and the glaucoma sub-analysis revealed clinical\ninaccuracies in the LLM-generated responses, which were appropriately\nidentified by the GPT-4 evaluation. Conclusion: The notable clinical alignment\nof GPT-4 evaluation highlighted its potential to streamline the clinical\nevaluation of LLM chatbot responses to healthcare-related queries. By\ncomplementing the existing clinician-dependent manual grading, this efficient\nand automated evaluation could assist the validation of future developments in\nLLM applications for healthcare.\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10083v1\nTitle: Unmemorization in Large Language Models via Self-Distillation and\nDeliberate Imagination\nAuthors: Yijiang River Dong, Hongzhou Lin, Mikhail Belkin, Ramon Huerta, Ivan Vulić\nAbstract: While displaying impressive generation capabilities across many tasks, Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) still struggle with crucial issues of privacy violation\nand unwanted exposure of sensitive data. This raises an essential question: how\nshould we prevent such undesired behavior of LLMs while maintaining their\nstrong generation and natural language understanding (NLU) capabilities? In\nthis work, we introduce a novel approach termed deliberate imagination in the\ncontext of LLM unlearning. Instead of trying to forget memorized data, we\nemploy a self-distillation framework, guiding LLMs to deliberately imagine\nalternative scenarios. As demonstrated in a wide range of experiments, the\nproposed method not only effectively unlearns targeted text but also preserves\nthe LLMs' capabilities in open-ended generation tasks as well as in NLU tasks.\nOur results demonstrate the usefulness of this approach across different models\nand sizes, and also with parameter-efficient fine-tuning, offering a novel\npathway to addressing the challenges with private and sensitive data in LLM\napplications.\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10052v1\nTitle: Anchor-based Large Language Models\nAuthors: Jianhui Pang, Fanghua Ye, Derek F. Wong, Longyue Wang\nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) predominantly employ decoder-only transformer\narchitectures, necessitating the retention of keys/values information for\nhistorical tokens to provide contextual information and avoid redundant\ncomputation. However, the substantial size and parameter volume of these LLMs\nrequire massive GPU memory. This memory demand increases with the length of the\ninput text, leading to an urgent need for more efficient methods of information\nstorage and processing. This study introduces Anchor-based LLMs (AnLLMs), which\nutilize an innovative anchor-based self-attention network (AnSAN) and also an\nanchor-based inference strategy. This approach enables LLMs to compress\nsequence information into an anchor token, reducing the keys/values cache and\nenhancing inference efficiency. Experiments on question-answering benchmarks\nreveal that AnLLMs maintain similar accuracy levels while achieving up to 99%\nkeys/values cache reduction and up to 3.5 times faster inference. Despite a\nminor compromise in accuracy, the substantial enhancements of AnLLMs employing\nthe AnSAN technique in resource utilization and computational efficiency\nunderscore their potential for practical LLM applications.\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07616v2\nTitle: T-RAG: Lessons from the LLM Trenches\nAuthors: Masoomali Fatehkia, Ji Kim Lucas, Sanjay Chawla\nAbstract: Large Language Models (LLM) have shown remarkable language capabilities\nfueling attempts to integrate them into applications across a wide range of\ndomains. An important application area is question answering over private\nenterprise documents where the main considerations are data security, which\nnecessitates applications that can be deployed on-prem, limited computational\nresources and the need for a robust application that correctly responds to\nqueries. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the most prominent\nframework for building LLM-based applications. While building a RAG is\nrelatively straightforward, making it robust and a reliable application\nrequires extensive customization and relatively deep knowledge of the\napplication domain. We share our experiences building and deploying an LLM\napplication for question answering over private organizational documents. Our\napplication combines the use of RAG with a finetuned open-source LLM.\nAdditionally, our system, which we call Tree-RAG (T-RAG), uses a tree structure\nto represent entity hierarchies within the organization. This is used to\ngenerate a textual description to augment the context when responding to user\nqueries pertaining to entities within the organization's hierarchy. Our\nevaluations show that this combination performs better than a simple RAG or\nfinetuning implementation. Finally, we share some lessons learned based on our\nexperiences building an LLM application for real-world use.\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07483v1\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nResearch_Action_1\n(\nto\nchat_manager\n)\n:\nBased on the retrieved abstracts, here is a markdown table categorizing the papers by domain, along with their titles, authors, summaries, and links:\n| Domain | Title | Authors | Summary | Link |\n|\n--------\n|\n-------\n|\n---------\n|\n---------\n|\n------\n|\n| Security | PRSA: Prompt Reverse Stealing Attacks against Large Language Models | Yong Yang, Xuhong Zhang, Yi Jiang, Xi Chen, Haoyu Wang, Shouling Ji, Zonghui Wang | The paper explores the security risks associated with exposing input-output pairs of prompts used in LLMs and proposes a novel attack framework, PRSA, to reverse-steal prompts, posing a threat to intellectual property rights. | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19200v1) |\n| Ethics & Evaluation | Political Compass or Spinning Arrow?

However, we observed a small class of errors, such as the LLM\\nrepeating itself or hallucinating fictitious information and human responses,\\nthat have the potential to derail conversations, raising important issues for\\nLLM application.\\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11571v1\\n\\n\\nTitle: Fine-tuning Large Language Model (LLM) Artificial Intelligence Chatbots\\n  in Ophthalmology and LLM-based evaluation using GPT-4\\nAuthors: Ting Fang Tan, Kabilan Elangovan, Liyuan Jin, Yao Jie, Li Yong, Joshua Lim, Stanley Poh, Wei Yan Ng, Daniel Lim, Yuhe Ke, Nan Liu, Daniel Shu Wei Ting\\nAbstract: Purpose: To assess the alignment of GPT-4-based evaluation to human clinician\\nexperts, for the evaluation of responses to ophthalmology-related patient\\nqueries generated by fine-tuned LLM chatbots. Methods: 400 ophthalmology\\nquestions and paired answers were created by ophthalmologists to represent\\ncommonly asked patient questions, divided into fine-tuning (368; 92%), and\\ntesting (40; 8%). We find-tuned 5 different LLMs, including LLAMA2-7b,\\nLLAMA2-7b-Chat, LLAMA2-13b, and LLAMA2-13b-Chat. For the testing dataset,\\nadditional 8 glaucoma QnA pairs were included. 200 responses to the testing\\ndataset were generated by 5 fine-tuned LLMs for evaluation. A customized\\nclinical evaluation rubric was used to guide GPT-4 evaluation, grounded on\\nclinical accuracy, relevance, patient safety, and ease of understanding. GPT-4\\nevaluation was then compared against ranking by 5 clinicians for clinical\\nalignment. Results: Among all fine-tuned LLMs, GPT-3.5 scored the highest\\n(87.1%), followed by LLAMA2-13b (80.9%), LLAMA2-13b-chat (75.5%),\\nLLAMA2-7b-Chat (70%) and LLAMA2-7b (68.8%) based on the GPT-4 evaluation. GPT-4\\nevaluation demonstrated significant agreement with human clinician rankings,\\nwith Spearman and Kendall Tau correlation coefficients of 0.90 and 0.80\\nrespectively; while correlation based on Cohen Kappa was more modest at 0.50.\\nNotably, qualitative analysis and the glaucoma sub-analysis revealed clinical\\ninaccuracies in the LLM-generated responses, which were appropriately\\nidentified by the GPT-4 evaluation. Conclusion: The notable clinical alignment\\nof GPT-4 evaluation highlighted its potential to streamline the clinical\\nevaluation of LLM chatbot responses to healthcare-related queries. By\\ncomplementing the existing clinician-dependent manual grading, this efficient\\nand automated evaluation could assist the validation of future developments in\\nLLM applications for healthcare.\\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10083v1\\n\\n\\nTitle: Unmemorization in Large Language Models via Self-Distillation and\\n  Deliberate Imagination\\nAuthors: Yijiang River Dong, Hongzhou Lin, Mikhail Belkin, Ramon Huerta, Ivan Vulić\\nAbstract: While displaying impressive generation capabilities across many tasks, Large\\nLanguage Models (LLMs) still struggle with crucial issues of privacy violation\\nand unwanted exposure of sensitive data. This raises an essential question: how\\nshould we prevent such undesired behavior of LLMs while maintaining their\\nstrong generation and natural language understanding (NLU) capabilities? In\\nthis work, we introduce a novel approach termed deliberate imagination in the\\ncontext of LLM unlearning. Instead of trying to forget memorized data, we\\nemploy a self-distillation framework, guiding LLMs to deliberately imagine\\nalternative scenarios. As demonstrated in a wide range of experiments, the\\nproposed method not only effectively unlearns targeted text but also preserves\\nthe LLMs' capabilities in open-ended generation tasks as well as in NLU tasks.\\nOur results demonstrate the usefulness of this approach across different models\\nand sizes, and also with parameter-efficient fine-tuning, offering a novel\\npathway to addressing the challenges with private and sensitive data in LLM\\napplications.\\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10052v1\\n\\n\\nTitle: Anchor-based Large Language Models\\nAuthors: Jianhui Pang, Fanghua Ye, Derek F. Wong, Longyue Wang\\nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) predominantly employ decoder-only transformer\\narchitectures, necessitating the retention of keys/values information for\\nhistorical tokens to provide contextual information and avoid redundant\\ncomputation. However, the substantial size and parameter volume of these LLMs\\nrequire massive GPU memory. This memory demand increases with the length of the\\ninput text, leading to an urgent need for more efficient methods of information\\nstorage and processing. This study introduces Anchor-based LLMs (AnLLMs), which\\nutilize an innovative anchor-based self-attention network (AnSAN) and also an\\nanchor-based inference strategy. This approach enables LLMs to compress\\nsequence information into an anchor token, reducing the keys/values cache and\\nenhancing inference efficiency. Experiments on question-answering benchmarks\\nreveal that AnLLMs maintain similar accuracy levels while achieving up to 99%\\nkeys/values cache reduction and up to 3.5 times faster inference. Despite a\\nminor compromise in accuracy, the substantial enhancements of AnLLMs employing\\nthe AnSAN technique in resource utilization and computational efficiency\\nunderscore their potential for practical LLM applications.\\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07616v2\\n\\n\\nTitle: T-RAG: Lessons from the LLM Trenches\\nAuthors: Masoomali Fatehkia, Ji Kim Lucas, Sanjay Chawla\\nAbstract: Large Language Models (LLM) have shown remarkable language capabilities\\nfueling attempts to integrate them into applications across a wide range of\\ndomains. An important application area is question answering over private\\nenterprise documents where the main considerations are data security, which\\nnecessitates applications that can be deployed on-prem, limited computational\\nresources and the need for a robust application that correctly responds to\\nqueries. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the most prominent\\nframework for building LLM-based applications. While building a RAG is\\nrelatively straightforward, making it robust and a reliable application\\nrequires extensive customization and relatively deep knowledge of the\\napplication domain. We share our experiences building and deploying an LLM\\napplication for question answering over private organizational documents. Our\\napplication combines the use of RAG with a finetuned open-source LLM.\\nAdditionally, our system, which we call Tree-RAG (T-RAG), uses a tree structure\\nto represent entity hierarchies within the organization. This is used to\\ngenerate a textual description to augment the context when responding to user\\nqueries pertaining to entities within the organization's hierarchy. Our\\nevaluations show that this combination performs better than a simple RAG or\\nfinetuning implementation. Finally, we share some lessons learned based on our\\nexperiences building an LLM application for real-world use.\\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07483v1\\n\\n\\n\", 'name': 'Retrieve_Action_2', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': \"Based on the retrieved abstracts, here is a markdown table categorizing the papers by domain, along with their titles, authors, summaries, and links:\\n\\n| Domain | Title | Authors | Summary | Link |\\n|\n--------\n|\n-------\n|\n---------\n|\n---------\n|\n------\n|\\n| Security | PRSA: Prompt Reverse Stealing Attacks against Large Language Models | Yong Yang, Xuhong Zhang, Yi Jiang, Xi Chen, Haoyu Wang, Shouling Ji, Zonghui Wang | The paper explores the security risks associated with exposing input-output pairs of prompts used in LLMs and proposes a novel attack framework, PRSA, to reverse-steal prompts, posing a threat to intellectual property rights. | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19200v1) |\\n| Ethics & Evaluation | Political Compass or Spinning Arrow?

Despite their capabilities, LLMs still encounter difficulties in completing tasks that require high levels of accuracy and complexity due to their inherent limitations in handling multifaceted problems single-handedly. This paper introduces \"Smurfs\", a cutting-edge multi-agent framework designed to revolutionize the application of LLMs. By transforming a conventional LLM into a synergistic multi-agent ensemble, Smurfs enhances task decomposition and execution without necessitating extra training. This is achieved through innovative prompting strategies that allocate distinct roles within the model, thereby facilitating collaboration among specialized agents. The framework gives access to external tools to efficiently solve complex tasks. Our empirical investigation, featuring the mistral-7b-instruct model as a case study, showcases Smurfs' superior capability in intricate tool utilization scenarios. Notably, Smurfs outmatches the ChatGPT-ReACT in the ToolBench I2 and I3 benchmark with a remarkable 84.4% win rate, surpassing the highest recorded performance of a GPT-4 model at 73.5%. Furthermore, through comprehensive ablation studies, we dissect the contribution of the core components of the multi-agent framework to its overall efficacy. This not only verifies the effectiveness of the framework, but also sets a route for future exploration of multi-agent LLM systems.         △ Less\nLink: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05955\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nScientist\n(\nto\nchat_manager\n)\n:\nBased on the abstract of the paper titled \"Smurfs: Leveraging Multiple Proficiency Agents with Context-Efficiency for Tool Planning,\" the key findings and potential applications of GPT-4 can be summarized as follows:\n### Key Findings:\n- The paper introduces \"Smurfs,\" a multi-agent framework that enhances the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 by transforming them into a synergistic multi-agent ensemble.

You can do so by running the following command in your shell.\n```sh\npip install matplotlib\n```\nOnce installed, you can execute the following code to generate the scatter plot and save it as `graph.png`.\n```python\n# filename: plot_google_products.py\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Data for plotting\nproducts = ['Google Search', 'Gmail', 'Google Maps', 'YouTube',\n'Google Chrome', 'Android', 'Google Drive', 'Google Home', 'Google Stadia']\nrelease_years = [1998, 2004, 2005, 2005, 2008, 2008, 2012, 2016, 2019]\n# Placing the products on the y-axis and years on the x-axis\ny_positions = range(len(products))\n# Creating the scatter plot\nplt.scatter(release_years, y_positions)\nplt.yticks(y_positions, products)\n# Adding title and labels\nplt.title('Release Years of Google Products')\nplt.xlabel('Year')\nplt.ylabel('Product')\n# Saving the plot\nplt.savefig('graph.png')\n# Show the plot for verification (this is optional and can be removed if only the file is needed)\nplt.show()\n```\nAfter you have executed the above script, `graph.png` will be saved in your current directory. Please run this code in your Python environment, and then you should find the `graph.png` file with the scatter plot of Google products and their release years.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n>>>>>>>> EXECUTING CODE BLOCK 0 (inferred language is sh)...\n>>>>>>>> EXECUTING CODE BLOCK 1 (inferred language is python)...\nuser_proxy\n(\nto\nchat_manager\n)\n:\nexitcode: 0 (execution succeeded)\nCode output:\nRequirement already satisfied: matplotlib in /home/beibinli/anaconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages (3.7.1)\nRequirement already satisfied: contourpy>=1.0.1 in /home/beibinli/anaconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages (from matplotlib) (1.0.5)\nRequirement already satisfied: cycler>=0.10 in /home/beibinli/anaconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages (from matplotlib) (0.11.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: fonttools>=4.22.0 in /home/beibinli/anaconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages (from matplotlib) (4.25.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: kiwisolver>=1.0.1 in /home/beibinli/anaconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages (from matplotlib) (1.4.4)\nRequirement already satisfied: numpy>=1.20 in /home/beibinli/anaconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages (from matplotlib) (1.24.4)\nRequirement already satisfied: packaging>=20.0 in /home/beibinli/anaconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages (from matplotlib) (23.2)\nRequirement already satisfied: pillow>=6.2.0 in /home/beibinli/anaconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages (from matplotlib) (10.1.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: pyparsing>=2.3.1 in /home/beibinli/anaconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages (from matplotlib) (3.0.9)\nRequirement already satisfied: python-dateutil>=2.7 in /home/beibinli/anaconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages (from matplotlib) (2.8.2)\nRequirement already satisfied: importlib-resources>=3.2.0 in /home/beibinli/anaconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages (from matplotlib) (5.13.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: zipp>=3.1.0 in /home/beibinli/anaconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages (from importlib-resources>=3.2.0->matplotlib) (3.11.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: six>=1.5 in /home/beibinli/anaconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages (from python-dateutil>=2.7->matplotlib) (1.16.0)\nFigure(640x480)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

Here's how I approached this task step by step:\n1. I wrote a Python function `is_prime(n)` to check if a given number `n` is prime. This function returns `True` if `n` is prime and `False` otherwise.\n2. I used a for loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to 10000, then called the `is_prime` function to determine if the current number is prime. If it is, I incremented a counter variable `count` by 1.\n3. I printed the value of `count` after the loop to display the total number of prime numbers in the given range.\nThe output `1229` confirms that there are indeed 1229 prime numbers between 1 and 10000.\nTERMINATE\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n>>>>>>>> NO HUMAN INPUT RECEIVED."

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.\nNote that this implementation uses recursion and may not be efficient for large values of `n`. In such cases, an iterative approach or memoization would be more appropriate.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\ncodeReviewer\n(\nto\nchat_manager\n)\n:\nI see a couple of issues with the current implementation of the `fibonacci` function:\n1. The function does not handle negative inputs correctly. Currently, it returns a string message for any input less than or equal to 0. It would be better to raise a `ValueError` or return a more informative message.\n2. The function uses recursion to calculate the Fibonacci number, which can be inefficient for large inputs. A more efficient approach would be to use an iterative approach or memoization.\nHere's an updated implementation that addresses these issues:\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\nif n <= 0:\nraise ValueError(\"Input should be a positive integer.\")\nelif n == 1:\nreturn 0\nelif n == 2:\nreturn 1\nelse:\na, b = 0, 1\nfor _ in range(n - 2):\na, b = b, a + b\nreturn b\n```\nThis implementation uses a loop to calculate the Fibonacci number iteratively, which is more efficient than the recursive approach. It also raises a `ValueError` for negative inputs, which is a more appropriate way to handle invalid inputs.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n>>>>>>>> USING AUTO REPLY...\n>>>>>>>> EXECUTING CODE BLOCK 0 (inferred language is python)...\nUserProxy\n(\nto\nchat_manager\n)\n:\nexitcode: 0 (execution succeeded)\nCode output:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\ncodeReviewer\n(\nto\nchat_manager\n)\n:\nI'm glad the updated implementation addresses the issues with the original code.

The sky appears blue because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases such as nitrogen and oxygen. These molecules scatter the light in all directions, but they scatter shorter (blue) wavelengths more than longer (red) wavelengths. This is why the sky looks blue during the daytime, especially in the direction of the sun.\nBut wait, there's more! The color of the sky can also change depending on the time of day and atmospheric conditions. For example, during sunrise and sunset, the sky can take on hues of red, orange, and pink due to the way that light interacts with the Earth's atmosphere. And if you're in a location with a lot of dust or pollution, the sky may appear more hazy or gray.\nSo there you have it! The sky is blue because of the way that light interacts with the Earth's atmosphere, and there are many factors that can affect its appearance. Is there anything else you'd like to know?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nProvide feedback to agent. Press enter to skip and use auto-reply, or type 'exit' to end the conversation: And what would it take to make it red?\nuser\n(\nto\nagent\n)\n:\nAnd what would it take to make it red?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n>>>>>>>> USING AUTO REPLY...\nagent\n(\nto\nuser\n)\n:\nAh, an interesting question! To make the sky appear red, we need to look at the scattering of light in a different way. When the sun is low on the horizon, the light it emits has to travel through a longer distance in the atmosphere to reach our eyes. As a result, much of the shorter wavelength blue light is scattered away, leaving mainly the longer wavelength red and orange light to reach our eyes. This is why the sky can take on hues of red, orange, and pink during sunrise and sunset.\nHowever, if we were to somehow change the composition of the atmosphere or add some additional particles into the air, we could potentially make the sky appear red even when the sun is high in the sky. For example, if we were to add a lot of dust or smoke into the atmosphere, the sky might take on a reddish hue due to the scattering of light by these particles. Or, if we were to create a situation where the air was filled with a high concentration of certain gases, such as nitrogen oxides or sulfur compounds, the sky could potentially appear red or orange as a result of the way that these gases interact with light.\nSo there you have it! While the sky is typically blue during the daytime due to Rayleigh scattering, there are many other factors that can affect its appearance, and with the right conditions, we can even make the sky appear red! Is there anything else you'd like to know?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nProvide feedback to agent.

As sunlight reaches Earth's atmosphere, it interacts with molecules and particles in the air, causing the scattering of light. Blue light has a shorter wavelength and gets scattered more easily than other colors, which is why the sky appears blue during a clear day.\nHowever, during sunrise and sunset, the sky can appear red, orange, or purple due to a different type of scattering called scattering by dust, pollutants, and water droplets, which scatter longer wavelengths of light more effectively.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nProvide feedback to agent.

This additional distance results in more scattering of sunlight, which preferentially scatters the longer wavelengths (red, orange, and yellow) more than the shorter wavelengths (blue and green).\nThe scattering of sunlight by the Earth's atmosphere causes the red, orange, and yellow colors to be more prevalent in the sky during sunrise and sunset, resulting in the beautiful display of colors often referred to as a sunrise or sunset.\nAs the sun continues to set, the sky can transition to various shades of purple, pink, and eventually dark blue or black, as the available sunlight continues to decrease and the longer wavelengths are progressively scattered less effectively.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nProvide feedback to agent.

The framework emphasizes customization and flexibility, enabling developers to define agent interaction behaviors in natural language or computer code.\nKey components of AutoGen include:\n1. **Conversable Agents**: These are customizable agents designed to operate autonomously or through human interaction. They are capable of initiating, maintaining, and responding within conversations, contributing effectively to multi-agent dialogues.\n2. **Conversation Programming**: AutoGen introduces a programming paradigm centered around conversational interactions among agents. This approach simplifies the development of complex applications by streamlining how agents communicate and interact, focusing on conversational logic rather than traditional coding for\nmats.\n3. **Agent Customization and Flexibility**: Developers have the freedom to define the capabilities and behaviors of agents within the system, allowing for a wide range of applications across different domains.\n4. **Application Versatility**: The paper outlines various use cases from mathematics and coding to decision-making and entertainment, demonstrating AutoGen's ability to cope with a broad spectrum of complexities and requirements.\n5. **Hierarchical and Joint Chat Capabilities**: The system supports complex conversation patterns including hierarchical and multi-agent interactions, facilitating robust dialogues that can dynamically adjust based on the conversation context and the agents' roles.\n6. **Open-source and Community Engagement**: AutoGen is presented as an open-source framework, inviting contributions and adaptations from the global development community to expand its capabilities and applications.\nThe framework's architecture is designed so that it can be seamlessly integrated into existing systems, providing a robust foundation for developing sophisticated multi-agent applications that leverage the capabilities of modern LLMs. The paper also discusses potential ethical considerations and future improvements, highlighting the importance of continual development in response to evolving tech landscapes and user needs."

The problem arises from several constraints and requirements:\n\nToken limits: LLMs have token limits that restrict the amount of textual data they can process. If we exceed these limits, we may encounter errors or incur additional costs. By preprocessing the chat history, we can ensure that we stay within the acceptable token range.\n\nContext relevance: As conversations progress, retaining the entire chat history may become less relevant or even counterproductive. Keeping only the most recent and pertinent messages can help the LLMs focus on the most crucial context, leading to more accurate and relevant responses.\n\nEfficiency: Processing long contexts can consume more computational resources, leading to slower response times."

Let's focus on the following three tasks:\n1. **Gathering data on Nvidia's stock price over the past month:**\n- A Python script can be written to use an API service like Alpha Vantage to obtain the stock price data.\n2. **Research recent news articles, press releases, or earnings reports that could explain Nvidia's stock price movements:**\n- Important information will be sought from reliable financial news sites and Nvidia's official channels.\n3. **Research market trends, economic factors, and industry-related developments that may have influenced Nvidia's performance:**\n- Using economic databases, financial news outlets, and market research reports, a comprehensive analysis will be conducted on the factors impacting the industry and Nvidia's market position.\nLet's begin by focusing on creating a Python script to get the stock price data. We'll need to perform the following steps:\n1. Choose an API to retrieve the data.\n2. Write a script using the chosen API and make necessary API calls.\n3. Parse the JSON or CSV response and organize it into a useful format.\n4. Clean the data if necessary.\n5. Perform preliminary analysis and visualize the data.\nPlease note that accessing an API service like Alpha Vantage might require an API key, which could involve signing up for the service and may be subject to their terms of service, including request limits.\nShall I proceed with writing the Python script to retrieve Nvidia's stock price data over the past month?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nuser_proxy\n(\nto\nassistant\n)\n:\nWrite script using yfinance package instead.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nassistant\n(\nto\nuser_proxy\n)\n:\nTo gather historical stock price information for Nvidia (NVDA) for the past month using the `yfinance` package, follow these steps:\n1. **Install the Package**: If you haven't already installed `yfinance`, do so by running `pip install yfinance` in your Python environment.\n2. **Import the Package**: Import `yfinance` into your script.\n3. **Request Stock Data**: Use the `yfinance` package to download the closing price data for Nvidia for the past month.\n4. **Plot the Data**: It can be useful to plot the data to visualize the stock's performance over the past month.\nBelow is the Python script that encompasses these steps:\n```python\nimport yfinance as yf\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Define the ticker symbol for Nvidia\nticker_symbol = 'NVDA'\n# Set the date range for the past month: assuming today is 2024-03-18\nstart_date = '2024-02-18'\nend_date = '2024-03-18'\n# Download the data from yfinance\nnvda_data = yf.download(ticker_symbol, start=start_date, end=end_date)\n# Select only the 'Close' column for plotting\nclosing_prices = nvda_data['Close']\n# Plot the closing prices\nplt.figure(figsize=(14, 7))\nplt.plot(closing_prices, label='NVDA Closing Prices')\nplt.title('NVDA Stock Closing Prices Over the Past Month')\nplt.xlabel('Date')\nplt.ylabel('Price (USD)')\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n```\nHere, `yfinance` downloads the data from Yahoo Finance for Nvidia between the desired dates (`start_date` and `end_date`). The script then uses `matplotlib` to create a simple line plot of the closing prices over this period.\nWould you like me to run this script and generate the plot for you?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nuser_proxy\n(\nto\nassistant\n)\n:\nInclude code for saving the dataset.

Over the past month, Nvidia's stock price has experienced significant movements, prompting investors and analysts to closely monitor the factors driving this volatility. In this blog post, we'll dive into the stock price performance of Nvidia from February 18 to March 18, 2024, and examine the key contributors to its fluctuations.\n## A Glimpse Into Nvidia's Stock Price Movement\nAnalysing the stock performance over the past month reveals a dynamic and eventful period for Nvidia. Starting on February 20, 2024, the stock opened at \\$719.47 and experienced a degree of instability, touching a monthly low of \\$674.68 on February 21 before surging to a stellar high of \\$785.34 on February 22. This upward momentum continued robustly until March 7, peaking at an admirable \\$926.69. However, this ascent was followed by a substantial correction, with prices adjusting to \\$878.37 by March 15, marking the end of our analysis period.\nThis turbulent period for Nvidia reflects a broader narrative of rapid adjustments and market reactions to a series of impactful events within the company and across the broader economic and technological ecosystems.\n## Unpacking the Influences on Nvidia's Stock Performance\nAs we sift through the economic news, earnings reports, and industry developments, a pattern of interrelated influences on the semiconductor giant's stock price becomes evident.\n### Product Launches and Technological Advancements\nNvidia's continued commitment to innovation is a significant driver of investor interest. The company's latest product releases and advancements in graphics processing units (GPU) often correlate with spikes in stock value. Given the company's historical patterns, it is plausible that Nvidia's announcements of enhanced GPU technologies for gaming and professional markets may have contributed positively to the observed stock price appreciation.\n### Economic and Industry Factors\nNvidia does not operate in a vacuum; it is influenced by the health of the global economy, trade policies, and tech industry dynamics. The semiconductor industry, in particular, is sensitive to supply chain disruptions and shifts in consumer demand for technology. Any news suggesting an easing of chip shortages or an uptick in demand for Nvidia's GPUs for data centers or automotive applications could be contributing factors to the company's stock trajectory.\n### Market Sentiment and Investor Confidence\nInvestor sentiment and confidence play crucial roles in stock performance. Nvidia's earnings reports often serve as a pulse check for shareholders, detailing the company's financial health and forecasts. A positive earnings report during this period may have reinforced confidence and catalysed further investments, propelling the stock prices to new heights.\nConversely, market corrections and profit-taking activities could also explain subsequent price adjustments, reminding us of the stock market's cyclical nature and investors' propensity to secure gains after a considerable run-up.\n## Conclusion\nNvidia's stock price journey between February and March 2024 exemplifies the intricate interplay between company-specific innovations, broader economic forces, and the investing community's sentiment. As with any investment, due diligence and a comprehensive understanding of market conditions are crucial to navigating the ebbs and flows.\nLooking ahead, Nvidia's future performance is likely to be swayed by its ability to maintain technological leadership, the unfolding economic climate, and its agility in adapting to industry challenges. Investors and enthusiasts alike would do well to watch the company's upcoming product revelations, quarterly reports, and industry trends for a clearer picture of what the future may hold for this semiconductor standard-bearer.\n*Disclaimer: The information provided in this analysis is for educational and entertainment purposes only and does not constitute financial advice.*\n---\nAnd there you have it—a draft blog post summarizing Nvidia's stock performance over the past month and considering various factors that could have influenced its stock price.

Write a blogpost about the stock price performance of Nvidia in the past month.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPlanner\n(\nto\nchat_manager\n)\n:\nTo write a blog post about Nvidia's stock price performance in the past month using Python code, you would need to gather and process the following information:\n1. Stock Price Data:\n- Historical daily closing prices of Nvidia stock (NVDA) for the past month.\n- Volume of shares traded each day over the past month.\n- Historical high and low prices for the past month.\n2. Company News and Events:\n- Any Nvidia-specific news that might have affected the stock price.\n- Relevant market news or technology sector news.\n- Details of any earnings reports, product launches, partnerships, acquisitions, or other announcements made by Nvidia in the past month.\n3. Market Context:\n- Overall stock market performance over the past month, especially comparing tech sector indices such as NASDAQ or S&P 500 Information Technology Sector.\n- Performance of Nvidia's competitors' stocks.\n- Any relevant macroeconomic indicators or events that might have affected the market.\n4. Technical Analysis Data (optional for a more in-depth analysis):\n- Technical indicators like moving averages, RSI (Relative Strength Index), MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence), etc.\n- Candlestick chart patterns for visual analysis and trend identification.\n5. Statistical Analysis:\n- Percent change in Nvidia's stock price over the past month.\n- Volatility measures such as standard deviation or average true range.\nTo retrieve this data using Python, you could use:\n- Financial and stock market APIs (such as Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, or IEX Cloud) to get historical stock price data and technical indicators.\n- Python libraries like `requests` for making API calls to news aggregator services for company news and market context.\n- Libraries like `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation and statistical analysis.\n- Visualization libraries such as `matplotlib` or `seaborn` for plotting stock price data and technical indicators if visual representation is desired in the blog post.\nOnce you've gathered the data, you'd analyze and organize it to tell the story of Nvidia's stock performance in the past month, including any notable ups and downs, and the contextual reasons why these movements may have occurred.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEngineer\n(\nto\nchat_manager\n)\n:\nTo create a blog post about the stock performance of Nvidia in the past month, I'll need to leverage financial APIs to retrieve historical stock price data and aggregate any relevant news for analysis. One popular library to achieve this is `yfinance`, which allows Python developers to download historical market data from Yahoo Finance.\nUnfortunately, as a language model developed by OpenAI, I can't directly perform web scraping or API calls to retrieve live data. However, I can provide you with a Python script that you can run on your own machine. This script will use `yfinance` to download the historical data for Nvidia (NVDA) and perform some basic analysis on it.\nHere's a Python script to retrieve Nvidia's historical stock price data for the past month and calculate some basic performance indicators:\n```python\nimport yfinance as yf\nimport pandas as pd\n# Define the ticker symbol for Nvidia, and the start and end dates\nticker_symbol = 'NVDA'\nstart_date = '2023-02-18'\nend_date = '2023-03-18'\n# Download historical stock price data for Nvidia\ndata = yf.download(ticker_symbol, start=start_date, end=end_date)\n# Calculate percentage change in closing price from the start date to the end date\npercentage_change = ((data['Close'].iloc[-1] - data['Close'].iloc[0]) / data['Close'].iloc[0]) * 100\n# Calculate the highest and lowest closing price in the past month\nhighest_price = data['High'].max()\nlowest_price = data['Low'].min()\n# Output summary statistics\nprint(\"Summary for NVDA from\", start_date, \"to\", end_date)\nprint(\"Closing price on\", start_date, \":\", data['Close'].iloc[0])\nprint(\"Closing price on\", end_date, \":\", data['Close'].iloc[-1])\nprint(\"Percentage change in the past month:\", round(percentage_change, 2), '%')\nprint(\"Highest closing price in the past month:\", round(highest_price, 2))\nprint(\"Lowest closing price in the past month:\", round(lowest_price, 2))\n# Note: You will need to install the yfinance and pandas packages if you haven't already.\n# You can install them using pip:\n# pip install yfinance pandas\n```\nPlease note that to run this code, you'll need to have Python installed on your system, along with `yfinance` and `pandas` packages. This script will give you a basic analysis of Nvidia's stock performance over the specified time frame. However, this script does not include any contextual analysis or news aggregation. To create a comprehensive blog post, you would also include analysis and commentary on events that may have influenced the stock's performance.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n>>>>>>>> NO HUMAN INPUT RECEIVED.\n>>>>>>>> USING AUTO REPLY...\n>>>>>>>> EXECUTING CODE BLOCK (inferred language is python)...\nExecutor\n(\nto\nchat_manager\n)\n:\nexitcode: 0 (execution succeeded)\nCode output: /Users/ekzhu/miniconda3/envs/autogen/lib/python3.11/site-packages/yfinance/utils.py:775: FutureWarning: The 'unit' keyword in TimedeltaIndex construction is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.

Investors and analysts alike have been watching the stock with keen interest, and for good reason. Between February 18 and March 18, 2024, NVDA has shown a considerable surge in value, providing shareholders with significant gains and outperforming many of its peers within the technology sector. Let's dive deeper into the numbers that tell the story of this Silicon Valley giant's latest financial triumph.\n## A Month of Gains\nNvidia's stock price saw a notable increase from $206.55 to $257.25—a staggering 24.55% rise within the short span of a month. This remarkable jump is not just a number; it reflects robust investor confidence and market sentiment towards the company's prospects.\n### The Highs and Lows\nEvery stock has its waves of volatility, and Nvidia was no exception. Despite the overall upward trend, the company experienced intraday highs and lows that tested the resilience of its shareholders. The trading period witnessed an all-time monthly high of $263.99, which likely coincided with positive news or earnings reports. The lowest dip was recorded at $204.21, a level that would have presented a lucrative buy opportunity for those bullish on the company's long-term growth.\n## What's Driving Nvidia's Surge?\nWhile this post provides a snapshot of Nvidia’s recent financial standing, it's also essential to explore the underlying factors contributing to the stock's performance. Here are a few potential drivers:\n- **Innovative Product Releases**: Nvidia's consistent push for innovation, especially in the realms of gaming and AI-driven technology, might have played a key role.\n- **Positive Earnings Reports**: High earnings figures can typically fuel investor enthusiasm, leading to a stock price increase.\n- **Market Trends**: Given the bigger picture, Nvidia's success could also be reflecting a larger trend in the tech market, perhaps driven by a return of investor confidence in tech stocks post a bearish phase.\n- **Strategic Partnerships or Acquisitions**: Any new alliances or acquisitions could have bolstered the company's market standing and expanded its operational reach.\n## Final Thoughts\nWhat we've seen with Nvidia is a testament to the fast-paced and rewarding nature of the tech stock market. As the company continues to push the envelope in high-performance computing and gaming, investors may have a lot to look forward to.\nRemember, while historical performance can provide valuable insights, it's always critical for investors to conduct comprehensive research and consider a multitude of factors when making investment decisions.\nThe financial figures presented here were retrieved and analyzed using financial APIs through specifically-crafted Python code, illustrating the power of combining financial insight with technological prowess.\nStay tuned to our blog for more updates and analyses on your favorite stocks!\n_Note: Data presented is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice._\n```\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

Nvidia Corporation, the technology giant known for its graphics processing units (GPUs) for gaming and professional markets, as well as its automotive and mobile processing products, has experienced a whirlwind of price movements. In this post, we'll scrutinize the stock price performance of Nvidia in the past month, exploring the possible reasons behind the fluctuations and analysing what it might mean for investors.\n### A Look at the Figures\nAs of the close of the market on March 17th, 2024, Nvidia's stock stood at approximately [insert closing price here], which represents a [insert percentage change] change over the last month. Data over the period reveals that the highest point the stock reached was [insert highest price], while the lowest was [insert lowest price]. The stock performance over the month demonstrated both resilience in the face of market uncertainty and susceptibility to broader economic forces.\n### Catalysts for Price Movement\nSeveral factors have influenced Nvidia's stock price performance over the past month:\n1. **Market Conditions:** The general state of the stock market, driven by macroeconomic indicators, can heavily impact individual stock performances. Interest rate adjustment rumors, inflation data, and strength or weakness in the broader technology sector are all primary contributors to the swings in Nvidia's stock price.\n2. **Earnings Report:** Nvidia's latest quarterly earnings report was released [insert release date], which often triggers a short-term reaction in stock price. The report highlighted [insert key highlights and figures], which led to an initial [insert reaction to the report, e.g., surge, dip, etc.] in stock value.\n3. **Product Releases:** Nvidia's announcement of [insert any new product or service], expected to push the technological envelope, has captured investors' interest, with the potential for future revenue growth factoring into stock valuations.\n4. **Industry Competition:** Actions from competitors may also have repercussions for Nvidia's stock, especially when major rivals release rival products or when there is significant news regarding semiconductor availability or supply chain issues that affect the whole industry.\n5. **Regulatory News:** Any changes in regulations that affect Nvidia's business operations, especially in large markets such as the United States, Europe, or China, can also influence investor confidence and, thus, share prices.\n### Technical and Fundamental Analysis\nTechnical analysts, who study statistical trends from trading activity, might note particular patterns in Nvidia's stock movements. Support and resistance levels, moving averages, and momentum indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) or Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), could all hint at potential future performance based on past and current price actions.\nMeanwhile, fundamental analysis digs deep into Nvidia's financial health and market position, reviewing revenue predictions, earnings growth, and profit margins. An assessment of the company's management effectiveness, competitive advantage, and market share may also help to gauge the stock's inherent value.\n### Forward-Looking Statement\nThe technology and finance sectors are notoriously difficult to predict. While historical data can provide context, they do not guarantee future performance. Nvidia's future stock prices will continue to be influenced by a blend of company-specific events and broader market conditions. Investors should remain attuned to Nvidia's product pipeline, technological advancements, and any geopolitical or economic updates that could sway market sentiment.\nInvesting in stocks always comes with a risk, and Nvidia is not immune to such uncertainties. Thus, a well-balanced, diversified portfolio is generally advisable to mitigate industry-specific risks.\n### Conclusion\nThe trajectory of Nvidia's stock price signifies the dynamic and complex nature of investing in technology firms. On one hand, Nvidia demonstrates strong fundamentals and a history of innovation; on the other, external factors beyond the company's control show just how interconnected global economic forces can be. Prudent investors will monitor these developments closely and make informed decisions based on both technical indicators and fundamental performance.\nPlease remember that this post is for informational purposes only and is not financial advice.

In this post, we'll scrutinize the stock price performance of Nvidia in the past month, exploring the possible reasons behind the fluctuations and analyzing what it might mean for investors.\n### A Look at the Figures\nAs of the close of the market on March 18th, 2024, Nvidia's stock stood at approximately $884.55, which represents a 27.37% change over the last month. Data over the period reveals that the highest point the stock reached was $926.69, while the lowest was $674.69. The stock performance over the month demonstrated both resilience in the face of market uncertainty and susceptibility to broader economic forces.\n### Catalysts for Price Movement\nSeveral factors have influenced Nvidia's stock price performance over the past month:\n1. **Market Conditions:** The general state of the stock market, driven by macroeconomic indicators, can heavily impact individual stock performances. Interest rate adjustment rumors, inflation data, and strength or weakness in the broader technology sector are all primary contributors to the swings in Nvidia's stock price.\n2. **Earnings Reports and Projections:** Given that earnings reports are typically released quarterly and have the potential to greatly affect stock prices, it's possible that a recent Nvidia earnings report or a projection of a future earnings report has played a role in stock price changes over the past month. Strong or weak financial performance, as would be reflected in such reports, could have been a catalyst for investor reaction.\n3. **Product Releases and Developments:** Nvidia is at the forefront of GPU technology and any announcements related to new products, updates to existing product lines, or advancements in research and development can have a significant impact on the investor outlook and, by extension, on the stock price.\n4. **Industry Competition and Market Share:** Nvidia's position compared to its competitors is also a key factor in its stock performance. Any fluctuations in market share or competitive edge could affect investor confidence and stock valuation.\n5. **Regulatory Changes and Global Events:** Regulatory changes in key markets or global events that impact the technology sector, trade relations, or supply chains can lead to shifts in stock prices as investors reassess their risk and potential returns.\n### Technical and Fundamental Analysis\nTechnical analysts, who study statistical trends from trading activity, might have identified particular patterns in Nvidia's stock movements suggesting the recent momentum. Trends such as support and resistance levels and other indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) or Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) provide insights that could potentially inform investors about the stock’s short-term movements.\nMeanwhile, fundamental analysis reveals the company's intrinsic value by looking at financial statements, market position, and growth prospects. Nvidia's innovation in technology and the strategic positioning of their products and services are aspects that are evaluated to make long-term investment decisions.\n### Forward-Looking Statements\nDespite the challenges of accurately predicting the stock market, Nvidia's recent performance indicates investor confidence in the company's growth potential and resilience. However, as is always the case with stock investments, past performance is not indicative of future results, and external factors can have unpredictable impacts on stock prices.\nInvesting in technology stocks like Nvidia often requires a keen eye on both company-specific news and broader economic indicators. Diversification remains a recommended strategy to mitigate potential risks associated with market volatility.\n### Conclusion\nThe past month's impressive rally in Nvidia's stock price underscores the company's strong performance and the market's optimistic assessment of its future outlook. However, investors must remain vigilant and informed as they navigate the ever-changing landscape of the technology sector. With careful analysis and consideration of both external factors and internal company developments, investors can make more informed decisions on whether to buy, hold, or sell Nvidia stock.\nPlease note: This blog post is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice. Investors should always conduct their own research or seek professional advice before making investment decisions.\n---\nWith the current figures now in hand, I have replaced the placeholders with accurate and updated data. The contextual analysis and underlying factors contributing to Nvidia's stock performance are also discussed, providing readers a comprehensive overview. If there are any further changes or updates needed, please let me know. Otherwise, I believe the task has been completed satisfactorily.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\neditor_finance_blogposts\n(\nto\nchat_manager\n)\n:\nTERMINATE\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAutobuild\nAssistant\n(\nto\nuser_proxy\n)\n:\nNvidia's stock price has seen a 27.37% increase over the past month with a closing price of $884.55 on March 18th, 2024.

However, you can obtain Nvidia's stock price performance by using financial data APIs such as Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, or others that provide stock price data.\nTo analyze Nvidia’s stock price performance over the past month, you can use the `yfinance` library in Python, which allows you to fetch historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance. Make sure you install the `yfinance` package before running the code if it's not already installed in your environment.\nBelow is the Python code block that fetches Nvidia's stock price data for the past month and performs a basic analysis of the price performance:\n```python\nimport yfinance as yf\nimport pandas as pd\n# Fetch Nvidia's stock data for the past month\nnvidia_stock = yf.Ticker(\"NVDA\")\nnvidia_df = nvidia_stock.history(period=\"1mo\")\n# Calculate some basic metrics\nlast_price = nvidia_df['Close'].iloc[-1]\nprice_change = nvidia_df['Close'] - nvidia_df['Close'].shift(1)\npercent_change = price_change / nvidia_df['Close'].shift(1) * 100\naverage_change = percent_change.mean()\nmax_price = nvidia_df['Close'].max()\nmin_price = nvidia_df['Close'].min()\nprint(f\"Nvidia's Stock Performance Over the Past Month:\\n\")\nprint(f\"Last Close Price: {last_price:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"Average Daily Percentage Change: {average_change:.2f}%\")\nprint(f\"Maximum Price: {max_price:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"Minimum Price: {min_price:.2f}\")\n```\nThe output of the print statements will give you Nvidia’s last close price, the average daily percentage change, and the maximum and minimum stock prices over the past month. Note that if you're looking for a more detailed analysis (e.g., predictive modeling, complex pattern recognition), you would need to apply more advanced financial analysis techniques and might also consider external factors impacting stock prices.\nThis is the output of the code blocks when executed:\n/Users/ekzhu/miniconda3/envs/autogen/lib/python3.11/site-packages/yfinance/utils.py:775: FutureWarning: The 'unit' keyword in TimedeltaIndex construction is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.

Without access to such data, I can provide you with a generic template of how to analyze and discuss stock performance for the blog post:\n[Blog Post Title]\n\"Analyzing Nvidia's Stock Performance: A Look Back Over the Past Month\"\n[Opening]\nAs one of the leading technology companies specializing in graphics processing units (GPUs), Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) remains a key player in the stock market.

To address this, we introduce Llama Guard as a custom agent in a 4-agents system.\n\nLlama Guard is designed to take both prompt and response as input for safety classification. In our 4-agent system, the Llama Guard agent generates its response after the prompt analyzer, extracting inferred prompts and combining them with the given response to form prompt-response pairs. These pairs are then passed to Llama Guard for safety inference.\n\nIf none of the prompt-response pairs are deemed unsafe by Llama Guard, the agent will respond that the given response is safe. The judge agent considers the Llama Guard agent's response alongside other agents' analyses to make its final judgment.\n\nAs shown in Table 4, introducing Llama Guard as a custom agent significantly reduces the False Positive Rate from 37.32% to 6.80% for the LLaMA-2-7b based defense, while keeping the ASR at a competitive level of 11.08%. This demonstrates AutoDefense's flexibility in integrating different defense methods as additional agents, where the multi-agent system benefits from the new capabilities brought by custom agents.\n\n"

Autogen packages up all that complexity into an agent I can create in one line, or modify with another.\n\nOver time, more and more users share their experiences in using or contributing to autogen.\n\nIn our Data Science department Autogen is helping us develop a production ready\nmulti-agents framework.\n\nSam Khalil, VP Data Insights & FounData, Novo Nordisk\n\nWhen I built an interactive learning tool for students, I looked for a tool that\ncould streamline the logistics but also give enough flexibility so I could use\ncustomized tools. AutoGen has both. It simplified the work. Thanks to Chi and his\nteam for sharing such a wonderful tool with the community.\n\nYongsheng Lian, Professor at the University of Louisville, Mechanical Engineering\n\nExciting news: the latest AutoGen release now features my contribution…\nThis experience has been a wonderful blend of learning and contributing,\ndemonstrating the dynamic and collaborative spirit of the tech community.\n\nDavor Runje, Cofounder @ airt / President of the board @ CISEx\n\nWith the support of a grant through the Data Intensive Studies Center at Tufts\nUniversity, our group is hoping to solve some of the challenges students face when\ntransitioning from undergraduate to graduate-level courses, particularly in Tufts'\nDoctor of Physical Therapy program in the School of Medicine. We're experimenting\nwith Autogen to create tailored assessments, individualized study guides, and focused\ntutoring. This approach has led to significantly better results than those we\nachieved using standard chatbots. With the help of Chi and his group at Microsoft,\nour current experiments include using multiple agents in sequential chat, teachable\nagents, and round-robin style debate formats. These methods have proven more\neffective in generating assessments and feedback compared to other large language\nmodels (LLMs) we've explored. I've also used OpenAI Assistant agents through Autogen\nin my Primary Care class to facilitate student engagement in patient interviews\nthrough digital simulations. The agent retrieved information from a real patient\nfeatured in a published case study, allowing students to practice their interview\nskills with realistic information.\n\nBenjamin D Stern, MS, DPT, Assistant Professor, Doctor of Physical Therapy Program,\nTufts University School of Medicine\n\nAutogen has been a game changer for how we analyze companies and products! Through\ncollaborative discourse between AI Agents we are able to shave days off our research\nand analysis process.\n\nJustin Trugman, Cofounder & Head of Technology at BetterFutureLabs\n\nThese are just a small fraction of examples. We have seen big enterprise customers’ interest from pretty much every vertical industry: Accounting, Airlines, Biotech, Consulting, Consumer Packaged Goods, Electronics, Entertainment, Finance, Fintech, Government, Healthcare, Manufacturer, Metals, Pharmacy, Research, Retailer, Social Media, Software, Supply Chain, Technology, Telecom…\n\nAutoGen is used or contributed by companies, organizations, universities from A to Z, in all over the world. We have seen hundreds of example applications. Some organization uses AutoGen as the backbone to build their agent platform. Others use AutoGen for diverse scenarios, including research and investment to novel and creative applications of multiple agents."

The transitions between states are controlled by heuristic rules or decisions made by the LLM, allowing for a dynamic and adaptive progression.\nUpon entering a state, a series of actions is executed, involving not only calling LLMs guided by different prompts, but also the utilization of external tools as needed."

The current StateFlow implementation also allows the user to override the transition graph.\nThese transitions can be based on the current speaker and static checking of the context history (for example, checking if 'Error' is in the last message).\n\nWe present an example of how to build a state-oriented workflow using GroupChat.\nWe define a custom speaker selection function to be passed into the\nspeaker_selection_method\nparameter of the GroupChat.\nHere, the task is to retrieve research papers related to a given topic and create a markdown table for these papers.\n\n\n\nWe define the following agents:"

For example, User always initiates the task first, followed by Planner creating a plan. Then Engineer and Executor work alternately, with Critic intervening when necessary, and after Critic, only Planner should revise additional plans. Each state can only exist at a time, and there are transition conditions between states. Therefore, GroupChat can be well abstracted as a Finite-State Machine (FSM).\n\n"

These three principles are:\n\nRepetition:\nLLMs are stochastic, and in many cases, so too is the code they write to solve problems. For example, a Python script might call an external search engine, and the results may vary run-to-run. This can lead to variance in agent performance. Repetition is key to measuring and understanding this variance. To this end, AutoGenBench is built from the ground up with an understanding that tasks may be run multiple times, and that variance is a metric we often want to measure.\n\nIsolation:\nAgents interact with their worlds in both subtle and overt ways. For example an agent may install a python library or write a file to disk. This can lead to ordering effects that can impact future measurements. Consider, for example, comparing two agents on a common benchmark. One agent may appear more efficient than the other simply because it ran second, and benefitted from the hard work the first agent did in installing and debugging necessary Python libraries. To address this, AutoGenBench isolates each task in its own Docker container. This ensures that all runs start with the same initial conditions. (Docker is also a\nmuch safer way to run agent-produced code\n, in general.)\n\nInstrumentation:\nWhile top-line metrics are great for comparing agents or models, we often want much more information about how the agents are performing, where they are getting stuck, and how they can be improved. We may also later think of new research questions that require computing a different set of metrics. To this end, AutoGenBench is designed to log everything, and to compute metrics from those logs. This ensures that one can always go back to the logs to answer questions about what happened, run profiling software, or feed the logs into tools like\nAgentEval\n."

If AutoGen happened to be run in a docker container then the risks of running code were minimized. However, if AutoGen runs outside of Docker, it's easy particularly for new users to overlook code-execution risks.\n\nAutoGen has now changed to by default execute any code inside a docker container (unless execution is already happening inside a docker container). It will launch a Docker image (either user-provided or default), execute the new code, and then terminate the image, preparing for the next code execution cycle.\n\nWe understand that not everyone is concerned about this especially when playing around with AutoGen for the first time. We have provided easy ways to turn this requirement off. But we believe that making sure that the user is aware of the fact that code will be executed locally, and prompting them to think about the security implications of running code locally is the right step for AutoGen."

Inspired by the\nfunction calling\ncapabilities provided by OpenAI,\nwe draw an analogy between model weights and agent functions/skills, and update an agent’s functions/skills based on its historical performance on a training set.\nSpecifically, we propose to use the function calling capabilities to formulate the actions that optimize the agents’ functions as a set of function calls, to support iteratively\nadding, revising, and removing\nexisting functions.\nWe also include two strategies, roll-back, and early-stop, to streamline the training process to overcome the performance-decreasing problem when training.\nAs an agentic way of training an agent, our approach helps enhance the agents’ abilities without requiring access to the LLM's weights."

It includes the following concepts:\n\nSkills\n: Skills are functions (e.g., Python functions) that describe how to solve a task. In general, a good skill has a descriptive name (e.g.\ngenerate_images\n), extensive docstrings and good defaults (e.g., writing out files to disk for persistence and reuse). You can add new skills to AutoGen Studio via the provided UI. At inference time, these skills are made available to the assistant agent as they address your tasks.\n\n\n\nAutoGen Studio Build View: View, add or edit skills that an agent can\r\nleverage in addressing tasks.\n\nAutoGen Studio Build View: View, add or edit skills that an agent can\r\nleverage in addressing tasks.\n\nAgents\n: This provides an interface to declaratively specify properties for an AutoGen agent (mirrors most of the members of a base\nAutoGen conversable agent\nclass).\n\nAgent Workflows\n: An agent workflow is a specification of a set of agents that can work together to accomplish a task. The simplest version of this is a setup with two agents – a user proxy agent (that represents a user i.e. it compiles code and prints result) and an assistant that can address task requests (e.g., generating plans, writing code, evaluating responses, proposing error recovery steps, etc.). A more complex flow could be a group chat where even more agents work towards a solution."

Next, we all yearn to understand how our developed systems perform, their utility for users, and, perhaps most crucially, how we can enhance them. Directly evaluating multi-agent systems poses challenges as current approaches predominantly rely on success metrics – essentially, whether the agent accomplishes tasks. However, comprehending user interaction with a system involves far more than success alone. Take math problems, for instance; it's not merely about the agent solving the problem. Equally significant is its ability to convey solutions based on various criteria, including completeness, conciseness, and the clarity of the provided explanation. Furthermore, success isn't always clearly defined for every task.\n\nRapid advances in LLMs and multi-agent systems have brought forth many emerging capabilities that we're keen on translating into tangible utilities for end users. We introduce the first version of\nAgentEval\nframework - a tool crafted to empower developers in swiftly gauging the utility of LLM-powered applications designed to help end users accomplish the desired task.\n\n\n\nFig. 2 provides  an overview of the tasks taxonomy\n\n\n\nLet's first look into an overview of the suggested task taxonomy that a multi-agent system can be designed for. In general, the tasks can be split into two types, where:\n\nIn our\nAgentEval\nframework, we are currently focusing on tasks where\nSuccess is clearly defined\n.

We observe that by comparing the performance of any of the three agents in successful cases (dark bars of any color) versus unsuccessful cases (lighter version of the same bar), we note that AgentEval was able to assign higher quantification to successful cases than that of failed ones. This observation verifies AgentEval's ability for task utility prediction.

But the assistant's memories and learnings are lost once the chat is over, or when a single chat grows too long for the LLM to handle effectively. Then in subsequent chats the user is forced to repeat any necessary instructions over and over.\n\nTeachability\naddresses these limitations by persisting user teachings across chat boundaries in long-term memory implemented as a vector database. Instead of copying all of memory into the context window, which would eat up valuable space, individual memories (called memos) are retrieved into context as needed. This allows the user to teach frequently used facts and skills to the teachable agent just once, and have it recall them in later chats.\n\nAny instantiated\nagent\nthat inherits from\nConversableAgent\ncan be made teachable by instantiating a\nTeachability\nobject and calling its\nadd_to_agent(agent)\nmethod.\nIn order to make effective decisions about memo storage and retrieval, the\nTeachability\nobject calls an instance of\nTextAnalyzerAgent\n(another AutoGen agent) to identify and reformulate text as needed for remembering facts, preferences, and skills. Note that this adds extra LLM calls involving a relatively small number of tokens, which can add a few seconds to the time a user waits for each response."

Initializing the Retrieval-Augmented User Proxy\nnecessitates specifying a path to the document collection. Subsequently, the Retrieval-Augmented\nUser Proxy can download the documents, segment them into chunks of a specific size, compute\nembeddings, and store them in a vector database.

Moreover, these models can communicate with humans through conversations and remember previous contexts, making it easier for humans to interact with them. These models play an increasingly important role in our daily lives assisting people with different tasks, such as writing emails, summarizing documents, and writing code.\n\nIn this blog post, we probe into the problem-solving capabilities of LLMs. Specifically, we are interested in their capabilities to solve advanced math problems, which could be representative of a broader class of problems that require precise reasoning and also have deterministic solutions.\n\nWe introduce MathChat, a conversational framework designed for solving challenging math problems with LLMs. This framework takes advantage of the chat-optimized feature of state-of-the-art LLMs, where a user proxy agent and an LLM assistant work together to tackle math problems. We also test previous prompting techniques for comparison."

We incorporate existing prompting methods such as CoT (chain-of-thought) and tool-using are incorporated in the initial prompt. Key components of the prompt include:\n\nTool-using Prompt:\nThis guides the LLM assistant to use Python code in the correct format to address the problem, allowing the user proxy agent to parse the code and provide the appropriate results.\n\nProblem-Solving Strategy Selection Prompt:\nThe assistant is instructed to choose one of three potential problem-solving strategies, including:\n\nFinal Answer Encapsulation Prompt:\nThis part instructs the assistant to put the final answer in\n\\boxed\n.\n\nThe prompt design in MathChat is flexible and can easily be refined to include other tools, such as Wolfram Alpha.\n\nLet's take a look at an example between the\nUser Proxy Agent\nand the\nLLM Assistant\n(GPT-4).

Moreover, these models can communicate with humans through conversations and remember previous contexts, making it easier for humans to interact with them. These models play an increasingly important role in our daily lives assisting people with different tasks, such as writing emails, summarizing documents, and writing code.\n\nIn this blog post, we probe into the problem-solving capabilities of LLMs. Specifically, we are interested in their capabilities to solve advanced math problems, which could be representative of a broader class of problems that require precise reasoning and also have deterministic solutions.\n\nWe introduce MathChat, a conversational framework designed for solving challenging math problems with LLMs. This framework takes advantage of the chat-optimized feature of state-of-the-art LLMs, where a user proxy agent and an LLM assistant work together to tackle math problems. We also test previous prompting techniques for comparison."

We incorporate existing prompting methods such as CoT (chain-of-thought) and tool-using are incorporated in the initial prompt. Key components of the prompt include:\n\nTool-using Prompt:\nThis guides the LLM assistant to use Python code in the correct format to address the problem, allowing the user proxy agent to parse the code and provide the appropriate results.\n\nProblem-Solving Strategy Selection Prompt:\nThe assistant is instructed to choose one of three potential problem-solving strategies, including:\n\nFinal Answer Encapsulation Prompt:\nThis part instructs the assistant to put the final answer in\n\\boxed\n.\n\nThe prompt design in MathChat is flexible and can easily be refined to include other tools, such as Wolfram Alpha.\n\nLet's take a look at an example between the\nUser Proxy Agent\nand the\nLLM Assistant\n(GPT-4).

In this blog post, we introduce RAG agents of\nAutoGen that allows retrieval-augmented generation. The system consists of two agents: a\nRetrieval-augmented User Proxy agent, called\nRetrieveUserProxyAgent\n, and a Retrieval-augmented Assistant\nagent, called\nRetrieveAssistantAgent\n, both of which are extended from built-in agents from AutoGen.\nThe overall architecture of the RAG agents is shown in the figure above.\n\nTo use Retrieval-augmented Chat, one needs to initialize two agents including Retrieval-augmented\nUser Proxy and Retrieval-augmented Assistant. Initializing the Retrieval-Augmented User Proxy\nnecessitates specifying a path to the document collection. Subsequently, the Retrieval-Augmented\nUser Proxy can download the documents, segment them into chunks of a specific size, compute\nembeddings, and store them in a vector database. Once a chat is initiated, the agents collaboratively\nengage in code generation or question-answering adhering to the procedures outlined below:"

But the assistant's memories and learnings are lost once the chat is over, or when a single chat grows too long for the LLM to handle effectively. Then in subsequent chats the user is forced to repeat any necessary instructions over and over.\n\nTeachability\naddresses these limitations by persisting user teachings across chat boundaries in long-term memory implemented as a vector database. Instead of copying all of memory into the context window, which would eat up valuable space, individual memories (called memos) are retrieved into context as needed. This allows the user to teach frequently used facts and skills to the teachable agent just once, and have it recall them in later chats.\n\nAny instantiated\nagent\nthat inherits from\nConversableAgent\ncan be made teachable by instantiating a\nTeachability\nobject and calling its\nadd_to_agent(agent)\nmethod.\nIn order to make effective decisions about memo storage and retrieval, the\nTeachability\nobject calls an instance of\nTextAnalyzerAgent\n(another AutoGen agent) to identify and reformulate text as needed for remembering facts, preferences, and skills. Note that this adds extra LLM calls involving a relatively small number of tokens, which can add a few seconds to the time a user waits for each response."

Next, we all yearn to understand how our developed systems perform, their utility for users, and, perhaps most crucially, how we can enhance them. Directly evaluating multi-agent systems poses challenges as current approaches predominantly rely on success metrics – essentially, whether the agent accomplishes tasks. However, comprehending user interaction with a system involves far more than success alone. Take math problems, for instance; it's not merely about the agent solving the problem. Equally significant is its ability to convey solutions based on various criteria, including completeness, conciseness, and the clarity of the provided explanation. Furthermore, success isn't always clearly defined for every task.\n\nRapid advances in LLMs and multi-agent systems have brought forth many emerging capabilities that we're keen on translating into tangible utilities for end users. We introduce the first version of\nAgentEval\nframework - a tool crafted to empower developers in swiftly gauging the utility of LLM-powered applications designed to help end users accomplish the desired task.\n\n\n\nFig. 2 provides  an overview of the tasks taxonomy\n\n\n\nLet's first look into an overview of the suggested task taxonomy that a multi-agent system can be designed for. In general, the tasks can be split into two types, where:\n\nIn our\nAgentEval\nframework, we are currently focusing on tasks where\nSuccess is clearly defined\n.

For instance,\n'the first agent was faster in execution,'\nor\n'the second agent moves more naturally.'\nSo, the comparative nature led humans to come up with a list of criteria that helps to infer the utility of the task.

As such, this figure illustrates an estimated performance of the three different agents, namely, Autogen (blue), Gpt-4 (red), and ReAct (green). We observe that by comparing the performance of any of the three agents in successful cases (dark bars of any color) versus unsuccessful cases (lighter version of the same bar), we note that AgentEval was able to assign higher quantification to successful cases than that of failed ones. This observation verifies AgentEval's ability for task utility prediction. Additionally, AgentEval allows us to go beyond just a binary definition of success, enabling a more in-depth comparison between successful and failed cases.\n\nIt's important not only to identify what is not working but also to recognize what and why actually went well."

It includes the following concepts:\n\nSkills\n: Skills are functions (e.g., Python functions) that describe how to solve a task. In general, a good skill has a descriptive name (e.g.\ngenerate_images\n), extensive docstrings and good defaults (e.g., writing out files to disk for persistence and reuse). You can add new skills to AutoGen Studio via the provided UI. At inference time, these skills are made available to the assistant agent as they address your tasks.\n\n\n\nAutoGen Studio Build View: View, add or edit skills that an agent can\r\nleverage in addressing tasks.\n\nAutoGen Studio Build View: View, add or edit skills that an agent can\r\nleverage in addressing tasks.\n\nAgents\n: This provides an interface to declaratively specify properties for an AutoGen agent (mirrors most of the members of a base\nAutoGen conversable agent\nclass).\n\nAgent Workflows\n: An agent workflow is a specification of a set of agents that can work together to accomplish a task. The simplest version of this is a setup with two agents – a user proxy agent (that represents a user i.e. it compiles code and prints result) and an assistant that can address task requests (e.g., generating plans, writing code, evaluating responses, proposing error recovery steps, etc.). A more complex flow could be a group chat where even more agents work towards a solution."

If you need to clear user-specific data, remove the relevant\nautogenstudio/web/files/user/<user_id_md5hash>\nfolder.\n\nQ: Is it possible to view the output and messages generated by the agents during interactions?\nA: Yes, you can view the generated messages in the debug console of the web UI, providing insights into the agent interactions. Alternatively, you can inspect the\ndatabase.sqlite\nfile for a comprehensive record of messages.\n\nQ: Where can I find documentation and support for AutoGen Studio?\nA: We are constantly working to improve AutoGen Studio. For the latest updates, please refer to the\nAutoGen Studio Readme\n. For additional support, please open an issue on\nGitHub\nor ask questions on\nDiscord\n.\n\nQ: Can I use Other Models with AutoGen Studio?\nYes. AutoGen standardizes on the openai model api format, and you can use any api server that offers an openai compliant endpoint. In the AutoGen Studio UI, each agent has an\nllm_config\nfield where you can input your model endpoint details including\nmodel name\n,\napi key\n,\nbase url\n,\nmodel type\nand\napi version\n. For Azure OpenAI models, you can find these details in the Azure portal. Note that for Azure OpenAI, the\nmodel name\nis the deployment id or engine, and the\nmodel type\nis \"azure\".\r\nFor other OSS models, we recommend using a server such as vllm to instantiate an openai compliant endpoint.\n\nQ: The Server Starts But I Can't Access the UI\nA: If you are running the server on a remote machine (or a local machine that fails to resolve localhost correstly), you may need to specify the host address. By default, the host address is set to\nlocalhost\n. You can specify the host address using the\n--host <host>\nargument. For example, to start the server on port 8081 and local address such that it is accessible from other machines on the network, you can run the following command:"

At present,\nGroupChat\nand the\nGroupChatManager\nare the main built-in tools for orchestrating conversations between 3 or more agents. For orchestrators like GroupChat to work well, they need to know something about each agent so that they can decide who should speak and when. Prior to AutoGen 0.2.2, GroupChat relied on each agent's\nsystem_message\nand\nname\nto learn about each participating agent. This is likely fine when the system prompt is short and sweet, but can lead to problems when the instructions are very long (e.g., with the\nAssistantAgent\n), or non-existent (e.g., with the\nUserProxyAgent\n).\n\nAutoGen 0.2.2 introduces a\ndescription\nfield to all agents, and replaces the use of the\nsystem_message\nfor orchestration in GroupChat and all future orchestrators. The\ndescription\nfield defaults to the\nsystem_message\nto ensure backwards compatibility, so you may not need to change anything with your code if things are working well for you. However, if you were struggling with GroupChat, give setting the\ndescription\nfield a try.\n\nThe remainder of this post provides an example of how using the\ndescription\nfield simplifies GroupChat's job,  provides some evidence of its effectiveness, and provides tips for writing good descriptions."

If AutoGen happened to be run in a docker container then the risks of running code were minimized. However, if AutoGen runs outside of Docker, it's easy particularly for new users to overlook code-execution risks.\n\nAutoGen has now changed to by default execute any code inside a docker container (unless execution is already happening inside a docker container). It will launch a Docker image (either user-provided or default), execute the new code, and then terminate the image, preparing for the next code execution cycle.\n\nWe understand that not everyone is concerned about this especially when playing around with AutoGen for the first time. We have provided easy ways to turn this requirement off. But we believe that making sure that the user is aware of the fact that code will be executed locally, and prompting them to think about the security implications of running code locally is the right step for AutoGen."

In addition to reporting top-line numbers, each AutoGenBench run produces a comprehensive set of logs and telemetry that can be used for debugging, profiling, computing custom metrics, and as input to\nAgentEval\n. In the remainder of this blog post, we outline core design principles for AutoGenBench (key to understanding its operation); present a guide to installing and running AutoGenBench; outline a roadmap for evaluation; and conclude with an open call for contributions."

                            "text": "AutoGenBench is designed around three core design principles. Knowing these principles will help you understand the tool, its operation and its output. These three principles are:\n\nRepetition:\nLLMs are stochastic, and in many cases, so too is the code they write to solve problems. For example, a Python script might call an external search engine, and the results may vary run-to-run. This can lead to variance in agent performance. Repetition is key to measuring and understanding this variance. To this end, AutoGenBench is built from the ground up with an understanding that tasks may be run multiple times, and that variance is a metric we often want to measure.\n\nIsolation:\nAgents interact with their worlds in both subtle and overt ways. For example an agent may install a python library or write a file to disk. This can lead to ordering effects that can impact future measurements. Consider, for example, comparing two agents on a common benchmark. One agent may appear more efficient than the other simply because it ran second, and benefitted from the hard work the first agent did in installing and debugging necessary Python libraries. To address this, AutoGenBench isolates each task in its own Docker container. This ensures that all runs start with the same initial conditions. (Docker is also a\nmuch safer way to run agent-produced code\n, in general.)\n\nInstrumentation:\nWhile top-line metrics are great for comparing agents or models, we often want much more information about how the agents are performing, where they are getting stuck, and how they can be improved. We may also later think of new research questions that require computing a different set of metrics. To this end, AutoGenBench is designed to log everything, and to compute metrics from those logs. This ensures that one can always go back to the logs to answer questions about what happened, run profiling software, or feed the logs into tools like\nAgentEval\n."

The transitions between states are controlled by heuristic rules or decisions made by the LLM, allowing for a dynamic and adaptive progression.\nUpon entering a state, a series of actions is executed, involving not only calling LLMs guided by different prompts, but also the utilization of external tools as needed."

For example, there are many comments like the following on X (Twitter) or YouTube.\n\nAutogen gave me the same a-ha moment that I haven't felt since trying out GPT-3\nfor the first time.\n\nI have never been this surprised since ChatGPT.\n\nMany users have deep understanding of the value in different dimensions, such as the modularity, flexibility and simplicity.\n\nThe same reason autogen is significant is the same reason OOP is a good idea. Autogen packages up all that complexity into an agent I can create in one line, or modify with another.\n\nOver time, more and more users share their experiences in using or contributing to autogen.\n\nIn our Data Science department Autogen is helping us develop a production ready\nmulti-agents framework.\n\nSam Khalil, VP Data Insights & FounData, Novo Nordisk\n\nWhen I built an interactive learning tool for students, I looked for a tool that\ncould streamline the logistics but also give enough flexibility so I could use\ncustomized tools. AutoGen has both. It simplified the work. Thanks to Chi and his\nteam for sharing such a wonderful tool with the community.\n\nYongsheng Lian, Professor at the University of Louisville, Mechanical Engineering\n\nExciting news: the latest AutoGen release now features my contribution…\nThis experience has been a wonderful blend of learning and contributing,\ndemonstrating the dynamic and collaborative spirit of the tech community.\n\nDavor Runje, Cofounder @ airt / President of the board @ CISEx\n\nWith the support of a grant through the Data Intensive Studies Center at Tufts\nUniversity, our group is hoping to solve some of the challenges students face when\ntransitioning from undergraduate to graduate-level courses, particularly in Tufts'\nDoctor of Physical Therapy program in the School of Medicine. We're experimenting\nwith Autogen to create tailored assessments, individualized study guides, and focused\ntutoring. This approach has led to significantly better results than those we\nachieved using standard chatbots. With the help of Chi and his group at Microsoft,\nour current experiments include using multiple agents in sequential chat, teachable\nagents, and round-robin style debate formats. These methods have proven more\neffective in generating assessments and feedback compared to other large language\nmodels (LLMs) we've explored. I've also used OpenAI Assistant agents through Autogen\nin my Primary Care class to facilitate student engagement in patient interviews\nthrough digital simulations. The agent retrieved information from a real patient\nfeatured in a published case study, allowing students to practice their interview\nskills with realistic information.\n\nBenjamin D Stern, MS, DPT, Assistant Professor, Doctor of Physical Therapy Program,\nTufts University School of Medicine\n\nAutogen has been a game changer for how we analyze companies and products! Through\ncollaborative discourse between AI Agents we are able to shave days off our research\nand analysis process.\n\nJustin Trugman, Cofounder & Head of Technology at BetterFutureLabs\n\nThese are just a small fraction of examples. We have seen big enterprise customers’ interest from pretty much every vertical industry: Accounting, Airlines, Biotech, Consulting, Consumer Packaged Goods, Electronics, Entertainment, Finance, Fintech, Government, Healthcare, Manufacturer, Metals, Pharmacy, Research, Retailer, Social Media, Software, Supply Chain, Technology, Telecom…\n\nAutoGen is used or contributed by companies, organizations, universities from A to Z, in all over the world. We have seen hundreds of example applications. Some organization uses AutoGen as the backbone to build their agent platform. Others use AutoGen for diverse scenarios, including research and investment to novel and creative applications of multiple agents."

To address this, we introduce Llama Guard as a custom agent in a 4-agents system.\n\nLlama Guard is designed to take both prompt and response as input for safety classification. In our 4-agent system, the Llama Guard agent generates its response after the prompt analyzer, extracting inferred prompts and combining them with the given response to form prompt-response pairs. These pairs are then passed to Llama Guard for safety inference.\n\nIf none of the prompt-response pairs are deemed unsafe by Llama Guard, the agent will respond that the given response is safe. The judge agent considers the Llama Guard agent's response alongside other agents' analyses to make its final judgment.\n\nAs shown in Table 4, introducing Llama Guard as a custom agent significantly reduces the False Positive Rate from 37.32% to 6.80% for the LLaMA-2-7b based defense, while keeping the ASR at a competitive level of 11.08%. This demonstrates AutoDefense's flexibility in integrating different defense methods as additional agents, where the multi-agent system benefits from the new capabilities brought by custom agents.\n\n"

You must follow the formats below to write your code:\n```language\n# your code\n```\nUser's question is: How can I use FLAML to perform a classification task and use spark to do parallel training. Train 30 seconds and force cancel jobs if time limit is reached.\nContext is: # Integrate - Spark\nFLAML has integrated Spark for distributed training. There are two main aspects of integration with Spark:\n- Use Spark ML estimators for AutoML.\n- Use Spark to run training in parallel spark jobs.\n## Spark ML Estimators\nFLAML integrates estimators based on Spark ML models. These models are trained in parallel using Spark, so we called them Spark estimators. To use these models, you first need to organize your data in the required format.\n### Data\nFor Spark estimators, AutoML only consumes Spark data. FLAML provides a convenient function `to_pandas_on_spark` in the `flaml.automl.spark.utils` module to convert your data into a pandas-on-spark (`pyspark.pandas`) dataframe/series, which Spark estimators require.\nThis utility function takes data in the form of a `pandas.Dataframe` or `pyspark.sql.Dataframe` and converts it into a pandas-on-spark dataframe. It also takes `pandas.Series` or `pyspark.sql.Dataframe` and converts it into a [pandas-on-spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/index.html) series. If you pass in a `pyspark.pandas.Dataframe`, it will not make any changes.\nThis function also accepts optional arguments `index_col` and `default_index_type`.\n- `index_col` is the column name to use as the index, default is None.\n- `default_index_type` is the default index type, default is \"distributed-sequence\". More info about default index type could be found on Spark official [documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/options.html#default-index-type)\nHere is an example code snippet for Spark Data:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom flaml.automl.spark.utils import to_pandas_on_spark\n# Creating a dictionary\ndata = {\n\"Square_Feet\": [800, 1200, 1800, 1500, 850],\n\"Age_Years\": [20, 15, 10, 7, 25],\n\"Price\": [100000, 200000, 300000, 240000, 120000],\n}\n# Creating a pandas DataFrame\ndataframe = pd.DataFrame(data)\nlabel = \"Price\"\n# Convert to pandas-on-spark dataframe\npsdf = to_pandas_on_spark(dataframe)\n```\nTo use Spark ML models you need to format your data appropriately. Specifically, use [`VectorAssembler`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.ml.feature.VectorAssembler.html) to merge all feature columns into a single vector column.\nHere is an example of how to use it:\n```python\nfrom pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler\ncolumns = psdf.columns\nfeature_cols = [col for col in columns if col != label]\nfeaturizer = VectorAssembler(inputCols=feature_cols, outputCol=\"features\")\npsdf = featurizer.transform(psdf.to_spark(index_col=\"index\"))[\"index\", \"features\"]\n```\nLater in conducting the experiment, use your pandas-on-spark data like non-spark data and pass them using `X_train, y_train` or `dataframe, label`.\n### Estimators\n#### Model List\n- `lgbm_spark`: The class for fine-tuning Spark version LightGBM models, using [SynapseML](https://microsoft.github.io/SynapseML/docs/features/lightgbm/about/) API.\n#### Usage\nFirst, prepare your data in the required format as described in the previous section.\nBy including the models you intend to try in the `estimators_list` argument to `flaml.automl`, FLAML will start trying configurations for these models. If your input is Spark data, FLAML will also use estimators with the `_spark` postfix by default, even if you haven't specified them.\nHere is an example code snippet using SparkML models in AutoML:\n```python\nimport flaml\n# prepare your data in pandas-on-spark format as we previously mentioned\nautoml = flaml.AutoML()\nsettings = {\n\"time_budget\": 30,\n\"metric\": \"r2\",\n\"estimator_list\": [\"lgbm_spark\"],  # this setting is optional\n\"task\": \"regression\",\n}\nautoml.fit(\ndataframe=psdf,\nlabel=label,\n**settings,\n)\n```\n[Link to notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/automl_bankrupt_synapseml.ipynb) | [Open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/automl_bankrupt_synapseml.ipynb)\n## Parallel Spark Jobs\nYou can activate Spark as the parallel backend during parallel tuning in both [AutoML](/docs/Use-Cases/Task-Oriented-AutoML#parallel-tuning) and [Hyperparameter Tuning](/docs/Use-Cases/Tune-User-Defined-Function#parallel-tuning), by setting the `use_spark` to `true`. FLAML will dispatch your job to the distributed Spark backend using [`joblib-spark`](https://github.com/joblib/joblib-spark).\nPlease note that you should not set `use_spark` to `true` when applying AutoML and Tuning for Spark Data. This is because only SparkML models will be used for Spark Data in AutoML and Tuning. As SparkML models run in parallel, there is no need to distribute them with `use_spark` again.\nAll the Spark-related arguments are stated below. These arguments are available in both Hyperparameter Tuning and AutoML:\n- `use_spark`: boolean, default=False | Whether to use spark to run the training in parallel spark jobs. This can be used to accelerate training on large models and large datasets, but will incur more overhead in time and thus slow down training in some cases. GPU training is not supported yet when use_spark is True. For Spark clusters, by default, we will launch one trial per executor. However, sometimes we want to launch more trials than the number of executors (e.g., local mode). In this case, we can set the environment variable `FLAML_MAX_CONCURRENT` to override the detected `num_executors`. The final number of concurrent trials will be the minimum of `n_concurrent_trials` and `num_executors`.\n- `n_concurrent_trials`: int, default=1 | The number of concurrent trials. When n_concurrent_trials > 1, FLAML performes parallel tuning.\n- `force_cancel`: boolean, default=False | Whether to forcely cancel Spark jobs if the search time exceeded the time budget. Spark jobs include parallel tuning jobs and Spark-based model training jobs.\nAn example code snippet for using parallel Spark jobs:\n```python\nimport flaml\nautoml_experiment = flaml.AutoML()\nautoml_settings = {\n\"time_budget\": 30,\n\"metric\": \"r2\",\n\"task\": \"regression\",\n\"n_concurrent_trials\": 2,\n\"use_spark\": True,\n\"force_cancel\": True,  # Activating the force_cancel option can immediately halt Spark jobs once they exceed the allocated time_budget.\n}\nautoml.fit(\ndataframe=dataframe,\nlabel=label,\n**automl_settings,\n)\n```\n[Link to notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/integrate_spark.ipynb) | [Open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/integrate_spark.ipynb)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nassistant\n(\nto\nragproxyagent\n)\n:\nTo perform a classification task using FLAML and use Spark to do parallel training for 30 seconds and force cancel jobs if the time limit is reached, you can follow these steps:\n1. First, convert your data into Spark dataframe format using `to_pandas_on_spark` function from `flaml.automl.spark.utils` module.\n2. Then, format your data for use SparkML models by using `VectorAssembler`.\n3. Define your AutoML settings, including the `metric`, `time_budget`, and `task`.\n4. Use `AutoML` from `flaml` to run AutoML with SparkML models by setting `use_spark` to `true`, and `estimator_list` to a list of spark-based estimators, like `[\"lgbm_spark\"]`.\n5. Set `n_concurrent_trials` to the desired number of parallel jobs and `force_cancel` to `True` to cancel the jobs if the time limit is reached.\nHere's an example code snippet for performing classification using FLAML and Spark:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom flaml.automl.spark.utils import to_pandas_on_spark\nfrom pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler\nimport flaml\n# Creating a dictionary\ndata = {\n\"sepal_length\": [5.1, 4.9, 4.7, 4.6, 5.0],\n\"sepal_width\": [3.5, 3.0, 3.2, 3.1, 3.6],\n\"petal_length\": [1.4, 1.4, 1.3, 1.5, 1.4],\n\"petal_width\": [0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2],\n\"species\": [\"setosa\", \"setosa\", \"setosa\", \"setosa\", \"setosa\"]\n}\n# Creating a pandas DataFrame\ndataframe = pd.DataFrame(data)\nlabel = \"species\"\n# Convert to pandas-on-spark dataframe\npsdf = to_pandas_on_spark(dataframe)\n# Format data for SparkML models\ncolumns = psdf.columns\nfeature_cols = [col for col in columns if col != label]\nfeaturizer = VectorAssembler(inputCols=feature_cols, outputCol=\"features\")\npsdf = featurizer.transform(psdf.to_spark(index_col=\"index\"))[\"index\", \"features\"]\n# Define AutoML settings\nsettings = {\n\"time_budget\": 30,\n\"metric\": \"accuracy\",\n\"task\": \"classification\",\n}\n# Use AutoML with SparkML models and parallel jobs\nautoml = flaml.AutoML()\nautoml.fit(\ndataframe=psdf,\nlabel=label,\nestimator_list=[\"lgbm_spark\"],\nuse_spark=True,\nn_concurrent_trials=2,\nforce_cancel=True,\n**settings,\n)\n```\nNote that the above code assumes the data is small enough to train within 30 seconds. If you have a larger dataset, you may need to increase the `time_budget` and adjust the number of parallel jobs accordingly.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nragproxyagent\n(\nto\nassistant\n)\n:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nassistant\n(\nto\nragproxyagent\n)\n:\nUPDATE CONTEXT\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUpdating context and resetting conversation.\nVectorDB returns doc_ids:  [['bdfbc921']]\nVectorDB returns doc_ids:  [['bdfbc921']]\nVectorDB returns doc_ids:  [['bdfbc921']]\nVectorDB returns doc_ids:  [['bdfbc921']]\nNo more context, will terminate.\nragproxyagent\n(\nto\nassistant\n)\n:\nTERMINATE\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

There are two main aspects of integration with Spark:\n- Use Spark ML estimators for AutoML.\n- Use Spark to run training in parallel spark jobs.\n## Spark ML Estimators\nFLAML integrates estimators based on Spark ML models. These models are trained in parallel using Spark, so we called them Spark estimators. To use these models, you first need to organize your data in the required format.\n### Data\nFor Spark estimators, AutoML only consumes Spark data. FLAML provides a convenient function `to_pandas_on_spark` in the `flaml.automl.spark.utils` module to convert your data into a pandas-on-spark (`pyspark.pandas`) dataframe/series, which Spark estimators require.\nThis utility function takes data in the form of a `pandas.Dataframe` or `pyspark.sql.Dataframe` and converts it into a pandas-on-spark dataframe. It also takes `pandas.Series` or `pyspark.sql.Dataframe` and converts it into a [pandas-on-spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/index.html) series. If you pass in a `pyspark.pandas.Dataframe`, it will not make any changes.\nThis function also accepts optional arguments `index_col` and `default_index_type`.\n- `index_col` is the column name to use as the index, default is None.\n- `default_index_type` is the default index type, default is \"distributed-sequence\". More info about default index type could be found on Spark official [documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/options.html#default-index-type)\nHere is an example code snippet for Spark Data:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom flaml.automl.spark.utils import to_pandas_on_spark\n# Creating a dictionary\ndata = {\n\"Square_Feet\": [800, 1200, 1800, 1500, 850],\n\"Age_Years\": [20, 15, 10, 7, 25],\n\"Price\": [100000, 200000, 300000, 240000, 120000],\n}\n# Creating a pandas DataFrame\ndataframe = pd.DataFrame(data)\nlabel = \"Price\"\n# Convert to pandas-on-spark dataframe\npsdf = to_pandas_on_spark(dataframe)\n```\nTo use Spark ML models you need to format your data appropriately. Specifically, use [`VectorAssembler`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.ml.feature.VectorAssembler.html) to merge all feature columns into a single vector column.\nHere is an example of how to use it:\n```python\nfrom pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler\ncolumns = psdf.columns\nfeature_cols = [col for col in columns if col != label]\nfeaturizer = VectorAssembler(inputCols=feature_cols, outputCol=\"features\")\npsdf = featurizer.transform(psdf.to_spark(index_col=\"index\"))[\"index\", \"features\"]\n```\nLater in conducting the experiment, use your pandas-on-spark data like non-spark data and pass them using `X_train, y_train` or `dataframe, label`.\n### Estimators\n#### Model List\n- `lgbm_spark`: The class for fine-tuning Spark version LightGBM models, using [SynapseML](https://microsoft.github.io/SynapseML/docs/features/lightgbm/about/) API.\n#### Usage\nFirst, prepare your data in the required format as described in the previous section.\nBy including the models you intend to try in the `estimators_list` argument to `flaml.automl`, FLAML will start trying configurations for these models. If your input is Spark data, FLAML will also use estimators with the `_spark` postfix by default, even if you haven't specified them.\nHere is an example code snippet using SparkML models in AutoML:\n```python\nimport flaml\n# prepare your data in pandas-on-spark format as we previously mentioned\nautoml = flaml.AutoML()\nsettings = {\n\"time_budget\": 30,\n\"metric\": \"r2\",\n\"estimator_list\": [\"lgbm_spark\"],  # this setting is optional\n\"task\": \"regression\",\n}\nautoml.fit(\ndataframe=psdf,\nlabel=label,\n**settings,\n)\n```\n[Link to notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/automl_bankrupt_synapseml.ipynb) | [Open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/automl_bankrupt_synapseml.ipynb)\n## Parallel Spark Jobs\nYou can activate Spark as the parallel backend during parallel tuning in both [AutoML](/docs/Use-Cases/Task-Oriented-AutoML#parallel-tuning) and [Hyperparameter Tuning](/docs/Use-Cases/Tune-User-Defined-Function#parallel-tuning), by setting the `use_spark` to `true`. FLAML will dispatch your job to the distributed Spark backend using [`joblib-spark`](https://github.com/joblib/joblib-spark).\nPlease note that you should not set `use_spark` to `true` when applying AutoML and Tuning for Spark Data. This is because only SparkML models will be used for Spark Data in AutoML and Tuning. As SparkML models run in parallel, there is no need to distribute them with `use_spark` again.\nAll the Spark-related arguments are stated below. These arguments are available in both Hyperparameter Tuning and AutoML:\n- `use_spark`: boolean, default=False | Whether to use spark to run the training in parallel spark jobs. This can be used to accelerate training on large models and large datasets, but will incur more overhead in time and thus slow down training in some cases. GPU training is not supported yet when use_spark is True. For Spark clusters, by default, we will launch one trial per executor. However, sometimes we want to launch more trials than the number of executors (e.g., local mode). In this case, we can set the environment variable `FLAML_MAX_CONCURRENT` to override the detected `num_executors`. The final number of concurrent trials will be the minimum of `n_concurrent_trials` and `num_executors`.\n- `n_concurrent_trials`: int, default=1 | The number of concurrent trials. When n_concurrent_trials > 1, FLAML performes parallel tuning.\n- `force_cancel`: boolean, default=False | Whether to forcely cancel Spark jobs if the search time exceeded the time budget. Spark jobs include parallel tuning jobs and Spark-based model training jobs.\nAn example code snippet for using parallel Spark jobs:\n```python\nimport flaml\nautoml_experiment = flaml.AutoML()\nautoml_settings = {\n\"time_budget\": 30,\n\"metric\": \"r2\",\n\"task\": \"regression\",\n\"n_concurrent_trials\": 2,\n\"use_spark\": True,\n\"force_cancel\": True,  # Activating the force_cancel option can immediately halt Spark jobs once they exceed the allocated time_budget.\n}\nautoml.fit(\ndataframe=dataframe,\nlabel=label,\n**automl_settings,\n)\n```\n[Link to notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/integrate_spark.ipynb) | [Open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/integrate_spark.ipynb)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nassistant\n(\nto\nragproxyagent\n)\n:\nThe author of FLAML is Chi Wang, along with several co-authors for various publications related to FLAML.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

There are two main aspects of integration with Spark:\\n\\n- Use Spark ML estimators for AutoML.\\n- Use Spark to run training in parallel spark jobs.\\n\\n## Spark ML Estimators\\n\\nFLAML integrates estimators based on Spark ML models. These models are trained in parallel using Spark, so we called them Spark estimators. To use these models, you first need to organize your data in the required format.\\n\\n### Data\\n\\nFor Spark estimators, AutoML only consumes Spark data. FLAML provides a convenient function `to_pandas_on_spark` in the `flaml.automl.spark.utils` module to convert your data into a pandas-on-spark (`pyspark.pandas`) dataframe/series, which Spark estimators require.\\n\\nThis utility function takes data in the form of a `pandas.Dataframe` or `pyspark.sql.Dataframe` and converts it into a pandas-on-spark dataframe. It also takes `pandas.Series` or `pyspark.sql.Dataframe` and converts it into a [pandas-on-spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/index.html) series. If you pass in a `pyspark.pandas.Dataframe`, it will not make any changes.\\n\\nThis function also accepts optional arguments `index_col` and `default_index_type`.\\n\\n- `index_col` is the column name to use as the index, default is None.\\n- `default_index_type` is the default index type, default is \"distributed-sequence\". More info about default index type could be found on Spark official [documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/options.html#default-index-type)\\n\\nHere is an example code snippet for Spark Data:\\n\\n```python\\nimport pandas as pd\\nfrom flaml.automl.spark.utils import to_pandas_on_spark\\n\\n# Creating a dictionary\\ndata = {\\n    \"Square_Feet\": [800, 1200, 1800, 1500, 850],\\n    \"Age_Years\": [20, 15, 10, 7, 25],\\n    \"Price\": [100000, 200000, 300000, 240000, 120000],\\n}\\n\\n# Creating a pandas DataFrame\\ndataframe = pd.DataFrame(data)\\nlabel = \"Price\"\\n\\n# Convert to pandas-on-spark dataframe\\npsdf = to_pandas_on_spark(dataframe)\\n```\\n\\nTo use Spark ML models you need to format your data appropriately. Specifically, use [`VectorAssembler`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.ml.feature.VectorAssembler.html) to merge all feature columns into a single vector column.\\n\\nHere is an example of how to use it:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler\\n\\ncolumns = psdf.columns\\nfeature_cols = [col for col in columns if col != label]\\nfeaturizer = VectorAssembler(inputCols=feature_cols, outputCol=\"features\")\\npsdf = featurizer.transform(psdf.to_spark(index_col=\"index\"))[\"index\", \"features\"]\\n```\\n\\nLater in conducting the experiment, use your pandas-on-spark data like non-spark data and pass them using `X_train, y_train` or `dataframe, label`.\\n\\n### Estimators\\n\\n#### Model List\\n\\n- `lgbm_spark`: The class for fine-tuning Spark version LightGBM models, using [SynapseML](https://microsoft.github.io/SynapseML/docs/features/lightgbm/about/) API.\\n\\n#### Usage\\n\\nFirst, prepare your data in the required format as described in the previous section.\\n\\nBy including the models you intend to try in the `estimators_list` argument to `flaml.automl`, FLAML will start trying configurations for these models. If your input is Spark data, FLAML will also use estimators with the `_spark` postfix by default, even if you haven\\'t specified them.\\n\\nHere is an example code snippet using SparkML models in AutoML:\\n\\n```python\\nimport flaml\\n\\n# prepare your data in pandas-on-spark format as we previously mentioned\\n\\nautoml = flaml.AutoML()\\nsettings = {\\n    \"time_budget\": 30,\\n    \"metric\": \"r2\",\\n    \"estimator_list\": [\"lgbm_spark\"],  # this setting is optional\\n    \"task\": \"regression\",\\n}\\n\\nautoml.fit(\\n    dataframe=psdf,\\n    label=label,\\n    **settings,\\n)\\n```\\n\\n[Link to notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/automl_bankrupt_synapseml.ipynb) | [Open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/automl_bankrupt_synapseml.ipynb)\\n\\n## Parallel Spark Jobs\\n\\nYou can activate Spark as the parallel backend during parallel tuning in both [AutoML](/docs/Use-Cases/Task-Oriented-AutoML#parallel-tuning) and [Hyperparameter Tuning](/docs/Use-Cases/Tune-User-Defined-Function#parallel-tuning), by setting the `use_spark` to `true`. FLAML will dispatch your job to the distributed Spark backend using [`joblib-spark`](https://github.com/joblib/joblib-spark).\\n\\nPlease note that you should not set `use_spark` to `true` when applying AutoML and Tuning for Spark Data. This is because only SparkML models will be used for Spark Data in AutoML and Tuning. As SparkML models run in parallel, there is no need to distribute them with `use_spark` again.\\n\\nAll the Spark-related arguments are stated below. These arguments are available in both Hyperparameter Tuning and AutoML:\\n\\n- `use_spark`: boolean, default=False | Whether to use spark to run the training in parallel spark jobs. This can be used to accelerate training on large models and large datasets, but will incur more overhead in time and thus slow down training in some cases. GPU training is not supported yet when use_spark is True. For Spark clusters, by default, we will launch one trial per executor. However, sometimes we want to launch more trials than the number of executors (e.g., local mode). In this case, we can set the environment variable `FLAML_MAX_CONCURRENT` to override the detected `num_executors`. The final number of concurrent trials will be the minimum of `n_concurrent_trials` and `num_executors`.\\n- `n_concurrent_trials`: int, default=1 | The number of concurrent trials. When n_concurrent_trials > 1, FLAML performes parallel tuning.\\n- `force_cancel`: boolean, default=False | Whether to forcely cancel Spark jobs if the search time exceeded the time budget. Spark jobs include parallel tuning jobs and Spark-based model training jobs.\\n\\nAn example code snippet for using parallel Spark jobs:\\n\\n```python\\nimport flaml\\n\\nautoml_experiment = flaml.AutoML()\\nautoml_settings = {\\n    \"time_budget\": 30,\\n    \"metric\": \"r2\",\\n    \"task\": \"regression\",\\n    \"n_concurrent_trials\": 2,\\n    \"use_spark\": True,\\n    \"force_cancel\": True,  # Activating the force_cancel option can immediately halt Spark jobs once they exceed the allocated time_budget.\\n}\\n\\nautoml.fit(\\n    dataframe=dataframe,\\n    label=label,\\n    **automl_settings,\\n)\\n```\\n\\n[Link to notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/integrate_spark.ipynb) | [Open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/integrate_spark.ipynb)\\n\\n', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': 'The author of FLAML is Chi Wang, along with several co-authors for various publications related to FLAML.', 'role': 'user'}], summary='The author of FLAML is Chi Wang, along with several co-authors for various publications related to FLAML.', cost=({'total_cost': 0.004711, 'gpt-35-turbo': {'cost': 0.004711, 'prompt_tokens': 3110, 'completion_tokens': 23, 'total_tokens': 3133}}, {'total_cost': 0}), human_input=[])"

You can adjust this value to control the total time spent on the experiment.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n>>>>>>>> NO HUMAN INPUT RECEIVED.\n>>>>>>>> USING AUTO REPLY...\nragproxyagent\n(\nto\nassistant\n)\n:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nassistant\n(\nto\nragproxyagent\n)\n:\nIs there anything else I can help you with?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n>>>>>>>> NO HUMAN INPUT RECEIVED."

You MUST NOT install any packages because all the packages needed are already installed.\nRule 2. You must follow the formats below to write your code:\n```language\n# your code\n```\nUser's question is: Is there a function named `tune_automl` in FLAML?\nContext is: # Integrate - Spark\nFLAML has integrated Spark for distributed training. There are two main aspects of integration with Spark:\n- Use Spark ML estimators for AutoML.\n- Use Spark to run training in parallel spark jobs.\n## Spark ML Estimators\nFLAML integrates estimators based on Spark ML models. These models are trained in parallel using Spark, so we called them Spark estimators. To use these models, you first need to organize your data in the required format.\n### Data\nFor Spark estimators, AutoML only consumes Spark data. FLAML provides a convenient function `to_pandas_on_spark` in the `flaml.automl.spark.utils` module to convert your data into a pandas-on-spark (`pyspark.pandas`) dataframe/series, which Spark estimators require.\nThis utility function takes data in the form of a `pandas.Dataframe` or `pyspark.sql.Dataframe` and converts it into a pandas-on-spark dataframe. It also takes `pandas.Series` or `pyspark.sql.Dataframe` and converts it into a [pandas-on-spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/index.html) series. If you pass in a `pyspark.pandas.Dataframe`, it will not make any changes.\nThis function also accepts optional arguments `index_col` and `default_index_type`.\n- `index_col` is the column name to use as the index, default is None.\n- `default_index_type` is the default index type, default is \"distributed-sequence\". More info about default index type could be found on Spark official [documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/options.html#default-index-type)\nHere is an example code snippet for Spark Data:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom flaml.automl.spark.utils import to_pandas_on_spark\n# Creating a dictionary\ndata = {\"Square_Feet\": [800, 1200, 1800, 1500, 850],\n\"Age_Years\": [20, 15, 10, 7, 25],\n\"Price\": [100000, 200000, 300000, 240000, 120000]}\n# Creating a pandas DataFrame\ndataframe = pd.DataFrame(data)\nlabel = \"Price\"\n# Convert to pandas-on-spark dataframe\npsdf = to_pandas_on_spark(dataframe)\n```\nTo use Spark ML models you need to format your data appropriately. Specifically, use [`VectorAssembler`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.ml.feature.VectorAssembler.html) to merge all feature columns into a single vector column.\nHere is an example of how to use it:\n```python\nfrom pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler\ncolumns = psdf.columns\nfeature_cols = [col for col in columns if col != label]\nfeaturizer = VectorAssembler(inputCols=feature_cols, outputCol=\"features\")\npsdf = featurizer.transform(psdf.to_spark(index_col=\"index\"))[\"index\", \"features\"]\n```\nLater in conducting the experiment, use your pandas-on-spark data like non-spark data and pass them using `X_train, y_train` or `dataframe, label`.\n### Estimators\n#### Model List\n- `lgbm_spark`: The class for fine-tuning Spark version LightGBM models, using [SynapseML](https://microsoft.github.io/SynapseML/docs/features/lightgbm/about/) API.\n#### Usage\nFirst, prepare your data in the required format as described in the previous section.\nBy including the models you intend to try in the `estimators_list` argument to `flaml.automl`, FLAML will start trying configurations for these models. If your input is Spark data, FLAML will also use estimators with the `_spark` postfix by default, even if you haven't specified them.\nHere is an example code snippet using SparkML models in AutoML:\n```python\nimport flaml\n# prepare your data in pandas-on-spark format as we previously mentioned\nautoml = flaml.AutoML()\nsettings = {\n\"time_budget\": 30,\n\"metric\": \"r2\",\n\"estimator_list\": [\"lgbm_spark\"],  # this setting is optional\n\"task\": \"regression\",\n}\nautoml.fit(\ndataframe=psdf,\nlabel=label,\n**settings,\n)\n```\n[Link to notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/automl_bankrupt_synapseml.ipynb) | [Open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/automl_bankrupt_synapseml.ipynb)\n## Parallel Spark Jobs\nYou can activate Spark as the parallel backend during parallel tuning in both [AutoML](/docs/Use-Cases/Task-Oriented-AutoML#parallel-tuning) and [Hyperparameter Tuning](/docs/Use-Cases/Tune-User-Defined-Function#parallel-tuning), by setting the `use_spark` to `true`. FLAML will dispatch your job to the distributed Spark backend using [`joblib-spark`](https://github.com/joblib/joblib-spark).\nPlease note that you should not set `use_spark` to `true` when applying AutoML and Tuning for Spark Data. This is because only SparkML models will be used for Spark Data in AutoML and Tuning. As SparkML models run in parallel, there is no need to distribute them with `use_spark` again.\nAll the Spark-related arguments are stated below. These arguments are available in both Hyperparameter Tuning and AutoML:\n- `use_spark`: boolean, default=False | Whether to use spark to run the training in parallel spark jobs. This can be used to accelerate training on large models and large datasets, but will incur more overhead in time and thus slow down training in some cases. GPU training is not supported yet when use_spark is True. For Spark clusters, by default, we will launch one trial per executor. However, sometimes we want to launch more trials than the number of executors (e.g., local mode). In this case, we can set the environment variable `FLAML_MAX_CONCURRENT` to override the detected `num_executors`. The final number of concurrent trials will be the minimum of `n_concurrent_trials` and `num_executors`.\n- `n_concurrent_trials`: int, default=1 | The number of concurrent trials. When n_concurrent_trials > 1, FLAML performs parallel tuning.\n- `force_cancel`: boolean, default=False | Whether to forcely cancel Spark jobs if the search time exceeded the time budget. Spark jobs include parallel tuning jobs and Spark-based model training jobs.\nAn example code snippet for using parallel Spark jobs:\n```python\nimport flaml\nautoml_experiment = flaml.AutoML()\nautoml_settings = {\n\"time_budget\": 30,\n\"metric\": \"r2\",\n\"task\": \"regression\",\n\"n_concurrent_trials\": 2,\n\"use_spark\": True,\n\"force_cancel\": True, # Activating the force_cancel option can immediately halt Spark jobs once they exceed the allocated time_budget.\n}\nautoml.fit(\ndataframe=dataframe,\nlabel=label,\n**automl_settings,\n)\n```\n[Link to notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/integrate_spark.ipynb) | [Open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/integrate_spark.ipynb)\n# Research\nFor technical details, please check our research publications.\n* [FLAML: A Fast and Lightweight AutoML Library](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/flaml-a-fast-and-lightweight-automl-library/).

The magnitude of the minority interest in the subsidiary company is generally less than 50 % of outstanding shares , or the corporation would generally cease to be a subsidiary of the parent . </P>\n<P> The balance sheet is the financial statement showing a firm 's assets , liabilities and equity ( capital ) at a set point in time , usually the end of the fiscal year reported on the accompanying income statement . The total assets always equal the total combined liabilities and equity in dollar amount . This statement best demonstrates the basic accounting equation - Assets = Liabilities + Equity . The statement can be used to help show the status of a company . </P>\n<P> The comptroller ( who is also auditor general and head of the National Audit Office ) controls both the Consolidated Fund and the National Loans Fund . The full official title of the role is Comptroller General of the Receipt and Issue of Her Majesty 's Exchequer . </P>\n<P> Financing activities include the inflow of cash from investors such as banks and shareholders , as well as the outflow of cash to shareholders as dividends as the company generates income . Other activities which impact the long - term liabilities and equity of the company are also listed in the financing activities section of the cash flow statement . </P>\n<P> It is frequently claimed that annual accounts have not been certified by the external auditor since 1994 . In its annual report on the implementation of the 2009 EU Budget , the Court of Auditors found that the two biggest areas of the EU budget , agriculture and regional spending , have not been signed off on and remain `` materially affected by error '' . </P>\n<P> The Ministry of Finance , Government of India announces the rate of interest for PPF account every quarter . The current interest rate effective from 1 January 2018 is 7.6 % Per Annum ' ( compounded annually ) . Interest will be paid on 31 March every year . Interest is calculated on the lowest balance between the close of the fifth day and the last day of every month . </P>\n<Table> <Tr> <Th> Quarter </Th> <Th> Interest Rate </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> April 2018 - June 2018 </Td> <Td> 7.6 % </Td> </Tr> </Table>\n<P> For a percentage of the settlement amount , Public adjusters work exclusively for the policyholder . This means there should be no inherent conflict of interest when it comes to advocating on the policyholder 's behalf to the insurance company . </P>\n<P> Accounts receivable is a legally enforceable claim for payment held by a business for goods supplied and / or services rendered that customers / clients have ordered but not paid for . These are generally in the form of invoices raised by a business and delivered to the customer for payment within an agreed time frame . Accounts receivable is shown in a balance sheet as an asset . It is one of a series of accounting transactions dealing with the billing of a customer for goods and services that the customer has ordered . These may be distinguished from notes receivable , which are debts created through formal legal instruments called promissory notes . </P>\n<P> A common synonym for net profit when discussing financial statements ( which include a balance sheet and an income statement ) is the bottom line . This term results from the traditional appearance of an income statement which shows all allocated revenues and expenses over a specified time period with the resulting summation on the bottom line of the report . </P>\n<Table> Electronic Fund Transfer Act <Tr> <Td colspan=\"2\"> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Other short titles </Th> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Financial Institutions Regulatory and Interest Rate Control Act of 1978 </Li> <Li> Change in Bank Control Act </Li> <Li> Change in Savings and Loan Control Act </Li> <Li> Depository Institution Management Interlocks Act </Li> <Li> Export - Import Bank Act Amendments </Li> <Li> Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council Act </Li> <Li> National Credit Union Central Liquidity Facility Act </Li> <Li> Right to Financial Privacy Act </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Long title </Th> <Td> An Act to extend the authority for the flexible regulation of interest rates on deposits and accounts in depository institutions . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Nicknames </Th> <Td> American Arts Gold Medallion Act </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Enacted by </Th> <Td> the 95th United States Congress </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Effective </Th> <Td> November 10 , 1978 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th colspan=\"2\"> Citations </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Public law </Th> <Td> 95 - 630 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Statutes at Large </Th> <Td> 92 Stat. 3641 aka 92 Stat. 3728 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th colspan=\"2\"> Codification </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Titles amended </Th> <Td> <Ul> <Li> 12 U.S.C. : Banks and Banking </Li> <Li> 15 U.S.C. : Commerce and Trade </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> U.S.C. sections amended </Th> <Td> <Ul> <Li> 12 U.S.C. ch. 3 § 226 et seq . </Li> <Li> 15 U.S.C. ch. 41 § 1601 et seq . </Li> <Li> 15 U.S.C. ch. 41 § 1693 et seq . </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th colspan=\"2\"> Legislative history </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td colspan=\"2\"> <Ul> <Li> Introduced in the House as H.R. 14279 by Fernand St. Germain ( D - RI ) on October 10 , 1978 </Li> <Li> Committee consideration by House Banking , Finance , and Urban Affairs , Senate Banking , Housing , and Urban Affairs </Li> <Li> Passed the House on October 11 , 1978 ( passed ) </Li> <Li> Passed the Senate on October 12 , 1978 ( passed ) with amendment </Li> <Li> House agreed to Senate amendment on October 14 , 1978 ( 341 - 32 , in lieu of H.

It is the specialized function directly associated with the top management . The significance of this function is not seen in the ' Line ' but also in the capacity of the ' Staff ' in overall of a company . It has been defined differently by different experts in the field . </P>\n<P> Form 990 ( officially , the `` Return of Organization Exempt From Income Tax '' ) is a United States Internal Revenue Service form that provides the public with financial information about a nonprofit organization . It is often the only source of such information . It is also used by government agencies to prevent organizations from abusing their tax - exempt status . Certain nonprofits have more comprehensive reporting requirements , such as hospitals and other health care organizations ( Schedule H ) . </P>\n<P> The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System , commonly known as the Federal Reserve Board , is the main governing body of the Federal Reserve System . It is charged with overseeing the Federal Reserve Banks and with helping implement monetary policy of the United States . Governors are appointed by the President of the United States and confirmed by the Senate for staggered 14 - year terms . </P>\n<P> The International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) is an international organization headquartered in Washington , D.C. , of `` 189 countries working to foster global monetary cooperation , secure financial stability , facilitate international trade , promote high employment and sustainable economic growth , and reduce poverty around the world . '' Formed in 1945 at the Bretton Woods Conference primarily by the ideas of Harry Dexter White and John Maynard Keynes , it came into formal existence in 1945 with 29 member countries and the goal of reconstructing the international payment system . It now plays a central role in the management of balance of payments difficulties and international financial crises . Countries contribute funds to a pool through a quota system from which countries experiencing balance of payments problems can borrow money . As of 2016 , the fund had SDR 477 billion ( about $668 billion ) . </P>\n<Li> Callability -- Some bonds give the issuer the right to repay the bond before the maturity date on the call dates ; see call option . These bonds are referred to as callable bonds . Most callable bonds allow the issuer to repay the bond at par . With some bonds , the issuer has to pay a premium , the so - called call premium . This is mainly the case for high - yield bonds . These have very strict covenants , restricting the issuer in its operations . To be free from these covenants , the issuer can repay the bonds early , but only at a high cost . </Li>\n<P> On November 7 , 2016 , debt held by the public was $14.3 trillion or about 76 % of the previous 12 months of GDP . Intragovernmental holdings stood at $5.4 trillion , giving a combined total gross national debt of $19.8 trillion or about 106 % of the previous 12 months of GDP ; $6.2 trillion or approximately 45 % of the debt held by the public was owned by foreign investors , the largest of which were Japan and China at about $1.09 trillion for Japan and $1.06 trillion for China as of December 2016 . </P>\n<P> A currency transaction report ( CTR ) is a report that U.S. financial institutions are required to file with FinCEN for each deposit , withdrawal , exchange of currency , or other payment or transfer , by , through , or to the financial institution which involves a transaction in currency of more than $10,000 . Used in this context , currency means the coin and / or paper money of any country that is designated as legal tender by the country of issuance . Currency also includes U.S. silver certificates , U.S. notes , Federal Reserve notes , and official foreign bank notes . </P>\n<P> Checks and balances is the principle that each of the Branches has the power to limit or check the other two and this creates a balance between the three separate powers of the state , this principle induces that the ambitions of one branch prevent that one of the other branches become supreme , and thus be eternally confronting each other and in that process leaving the people free from government abuses . Checks and Balances are designed to maintain the system of separation of powers keeping each branch in its place . This is based on the idea that it is not enough to separate the powers and guarantee their independence but to give the various branches the constitutional means to defend their own legitimate powers from the encroachments of the other branches . They guarantee that the powers of the State have the same weight ( co-equal ) , that is , to be balanced , so that they can limit each other , avoiding the abuse of state power . the origin of checks and balances , like separation of powers itself , is specifically credited to Montesquieu in the Enlightenment ( in The Spirit of the Laws , 1748 ) , under this influence was implemented in 1787 in the Constitution of the United States . </P>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nassistant\n(\nto\nragproxyagent\n)\n:\nNon controlling interest on balance sheet refers to the portion of a subsidiary corporation's stock that is not owned by the parent corporation.

However , the problems associated with handling a bull ( particularly where cows must be removed from its presence to be worked ) has prompted many dairy farmers to restrict themselves to artificial insemination ( AI ) of the cows . Semen is removed from the bulls and stored in canisters of liquid nitrogen , where it is kept until it can be sold , at which time it can be very profitable , in fact , many ranchers keep bulls specifically for this purpose . AI is also used to increase the quality of a herd , or to introduce an outcross of bloodlines . Some ranchers prefer to use AI to allow them to breed to several different bulls in a season or to breed their best stock to a higher quality bull than they could afford to purchase outright . AI may also be used in conjunction with embryo transfer to allow cattle producers to add new breeding to their herds . </P>\n<P> Other than the few bulls needed for breeding , the vast majority of male cattle are slaughtered for meat before the age of three years , except where they are needed ( castrated ) as work oxen for haulage . Most of these beef animals are castrated as calves to reduce aggressive behavior and prevent unwanted mating , although some are reared as uncastrated bull beef . A bull is typically ready for slaughter one or two months sooner than a castrated male or a female , and produces proportionately more , leaner muscle . </P>\n<P> Pastoral farming is the major land use but there are increases in land area devoted to horticulture . </P>\n<P> Animal fibers are natural fibers that consist largely of particular proteins . Instances are silk , hair / fur ( including wool ) and feathers . The animal fibers used most commonly both in the manufacturing world as well as by the hand spinners are wool from domestic sheep and silk . Also very popular are alpaca fiber and mohair from Angora goats . Unusual fibers such as Angora wool from rabbits and Chiengora from dogs also exist , but are rarely used for mass production . </P>\n<P> In 2012 , there were 3.2 million farmers , ranchers and other agricultural managers and an estimated 757,900 agricultural workers were legally employed in the US . Animal breeders accounted for 11,500 of those workers with the rest categorized as miscellaneous agricultural workers . The median pay was $9.12 per hour or $18,970 per year . In 2009 , about 519,000 people under age 20 worked on farms owned by their family . In addition to the youth who lived on family farms , an additional 230,000 youth were employed in agriculture . In 2004 , women made up approximately 24 % of farmers ; that year , there were 580,000 women employed in agriculture , forestry , and fishing . </P>\n<P> The recipe can vary widely . The defining ingredients are minced meat ( commonly beef when named cottage pie or lamb when named shepherd 's pie ) , typically cooked in a gravy with onions and sometimes other vegetables , such as peas , celery or carrots , and topped with mashed potato . The pie is sometimes also topped with grated cheese . </P>\n<P> The history of the domesticated sheep goes back to between 11000 and 9000 BC , and the domestication of the wild mouflon in ancient Mesopotamia . Sheep are among the first animals to have been domesticated by humans , and there is evidence of sheep farming in Iranian statuary dating to that time period . These sheep were primarily raised for meat , milk , and skins . Woolly sheep began to be developed around 6000 BC in Iran , and cultures such as the Persians relied on sheep 's wool for trading . They were then imported to Africa and Europe via trading . </P>\n<P> Although large - scale use of wheels did not occur in the Americas prior to European contact , numerous small wheeled artifacts , identified as children 's toys , have been found in Mexican archeological sites , some dating to about 1500 BC . It is thought that the primary obstacle to large - scale development of the wheel in the Americas was the absence of domesticated large animals which could be used to pull wheeled carriages . The closest relative of cattle present in Americas in pre-Columbian times , the American Bison , is difficult to domesticate and was never domesticated by Native Americans ; several horse species existed until about 12,000 years ago , but ultimately became extinct . The only large animal that was domesticated in the Western hemisphere , the llama , did not spread far beyond the Andes by the time of the arrival of Columbus . </P>\n<P> The Call of the Wild is a short adventure novel by Jack London published in 1903 and set in Yukon , Canada during the 1890s Klondike Gold Rush , when strong sled dogs were in high demand . The central character of the novel is a dog named Buck . The story opens at a ranch in Santa Clara Valley , California , when Buck is stolen from his home and sold into service as a sled dog in Alaska . He becomes progressively feral in the harsh environment , where he is forced to fight to survive and dominate other dogs . By the end , he sheds the veneer of civilization , and relies on primordial instinct and learned experience to emerge as a leader in the wild . </P>\n<P> The Three Little Pigs was included in The Nursery Rhymes of England ( London and New York , c. 1886 ) , by James Halliwell - Phillipps . The story in its arguably best - known form appeared in English Fairy Tales by Joseph Jacobs , first published in 1890 and crediting Halliwell as his source . The story begins with the title characters being sent out into the world by their mother , to `` seek out their fortune '' . The first little pig builds a house of straw , but a wolf blows it down and devours him . The second little pig builds a house of sticks , which the wolf also blows down , and the second little pig is also devoured . Each exchange between wolf and pig features ringing proverbial phrases , namely : </P>\n<P> `` How now brown cow '' ( / ˈhaʊ ˈnaʊ ˈbraʊn ˈkaʊ / ) is a phrase used in elocution teaching to demonstrate rounded vowel sounds . Each `` ow '' sound in the phrase represents the diphthong / aʊ / . Although orthographies for each of the four words in this utterance is represented by the English spelling `` ow '' , the articulation required to create this same diphthong represented by the International Phonetic Association 's phonetic alphabet as / aʊ / is also represented by the spelling `` ou '' . Some examples of these homophonic / aʊ / 's are the English words `` house '' , `` blouse '' , `` noun '' , and `` cloud '' . The use of the phrase `` how now brown cow '' in teaching elocution can be dated back to at least 1926 . Although not in use today , the phrase `` how now '' is a greeting , short for `` how say you now '' , and can be found in archaic literature , such as the plays of William Shakespeare . </P>\n<P> Brisket is a cut of meat from the breast or lower chest of beef or veal . The beef brisket is one of the nine beef primal cuts , though the precise definition of the cut differs internationally . The brisket muscles include the superficial and deep pectorals . As cattle do not have collar bones , these muscles support about 60 % of the body weight of standing / moving cattle . This requires a significant amount of connective tissue , so the resulting meat must be cooked correctly to tenderize the connective tissue . </P>\n<P> The music to `` Man Gave Names to All the Animals '' is reggae - inspired . The lyrics were inspired by the biblical Book of Genesis , verses 2 : 19 -- 20 in which Adam named the animals and birds . The lyrics have an appeal to children , rhyming the name of the animal with one of its characteristics . So after describing an animal 's `` muddy trail '' and `` curly tail , '' Dylan sings that `` he was n't too small and he was n't too big '' and so that animal was named a pig . Similarly , the cow got its name because Adam `` saw milk comin ' out but he did n't know how '' and the bear got its name because it has a `` great big furry back and furry hair . '' </P>\n<P> As early as 1671 railed roads were in use in Durham to ease the conveyance of coal ; the first of these was the Tanfield Wagonway . Many of these tramroads or wagon ways were built in the 17th and 18th centuries . They used simply straight and parallel rails of timber on which carts with simple flanged iron wheels were drawn by horses , enabling several wagons to be moved simultaneously . </P>\n<P> Unicorns are not found in Greek mythology , but rather in the accounts of natural history , for Greek writers of natural history were convinced of the reality of unicorns , which they believed lived in India , a distant and fabulous realm for them . The earliest description is from Ctesias , who in his book Indika ( `` On India '' ) described them as wild asses , fleet of foot , having a horn a cubit and a half ( 700 mm , 28 inches ) in length , and colored white , red and black . Aristotle must be following Ctesias when he mentions two one - horned animals , the oryx ( a kind of antelope ) and the so - called `` Indian ass '' . Strabo says that in the Caucasus there were one - horned horses with stag - like heads . Pliny the Elder mentions the oryx and an Indian ox ( perhaps a rhinoceros ) as one - horned beasts , as well as `` a very fierce animal called the monoceros which has the head of the stag , the feet of the elephant , and the tail of the boar , while the rest of the body is like that of the horse ; it makes a deep lowing noise , and has a single black horn , which projects from the middle of its forehead , two cubits ( 900 mm , 35 inches ) in length . '' In On the Nature of Animals ( Περὶ Ζῴων Ἰδιότητος , De natura animalium ) , Aelian , quoting Ctesias , adds that India produces also a one - horned horse ( iii. 41 ; iv. 52 ) , and says ( xvi. 20 ) that the monoceros ( Greek : μονόκερως ) was sometimes called cartazonos ( Greek : καρτάζωνος ) , which may be a form of the Arabic karkadann , meaning `` rhinoceros '' . </P>\n<P> The First Battle of Bull Run ( the name used by Union forces ) , also known as the First Battle of Manassas ( the name used by Confederate forces ) , was fought on July 21 , 1861 in Prince William County , Virginia , just north of the city of Manassas and about 25 miles west - southwest of Washington , D.C. It was the first major battle of the American Civil War . The Union 's forces were slow in positioning themselves , allowing Confederate reinforcements time to arrive by rail . Each side had about 18,000 poorly trained and poorly led troops in their first battle . It was a Confederate victory , followed by a disorganized retreat of the Union forces . </P>\n<P> Hops production is concentrated in moist temperate climates , with much of the world 's production occurring near the 48th parallel north . Hop plants prefer the same soils as potatoes and the leading potato - growing states in the United States are also major hops - producing areas ; however , not all potato - growing areas can produce good hops naturally : soils in the Maritime Provinces of Canada , for example , lack the boron that hops prefer . Historically , hops were not grown in Ireland , but were imported from England . In 1752 more than 500 tons of English hops were imported through Dublin alone . </P>\n<P> Shepherd 's pie or cottage pie is a meat pie with a crust of mashed potato . </P>\n<P> Castles served a range of purposes , the most important of which were military , administrative , and domestic . As well as defensive structures , castles were also offensive tools which could be used as a base of operations in enemy territory . Castles were established by Norman invaders of England for both defensive purposes and to pacify the country 's inhabitants . As William the Conqueror advanced through England , he fortified key positions to secure the land he had taken . Between 1066 and 1087 , he established 36 castles such as Warwick Castle , which he used to guard against rebellion in the English Midlands . </P>\n<P> The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show remained in syndicated reruns and was still available for local television stations through The Program Exchange as late as 2016 ; WBBZ - TV , for instance , aired the show in a strip to counterprogram 10 PM newscasts in the Buffalo , New York market during the summer 2013 season . The underlying rights are now owned by Universal Pictures , which holds the library of predecessor companies DreamWorks Animation and Classic Media , and who in turn with copyright holder Ward Productions forms the joint venture Bullwinkle Studios , which manages the Rocky and Bullwinkle properties ; Universal 's purchase of Classic Media coincided with The Program Exchange 's shutdown . </P>\n<P> When Yellowstone National Park was created in 1872 , gray wolf ( Canis lupus ) populations were already in decline in Montana , Wyoming and Idaho . The creation of the national park did not provide protection for wolves or other predators , and government predator control programs in the first decades of the 1900s essentially helped eliminate the gray wolf from Yellowstone . The last wolves were killed in Yellowstone in 1926 . After that time , sporadic reports of wolves still occurred , but scientists confirmed that sustainable wolf populations had been extirpated and were absent from Yellowstone during the mid-1900s . </P>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nassistant\n(\nto\nragproxyagent\n)\n:\nBulls are used for breeding and often kept for their semen to sell for AI purposes.

It was the twelfth edition of the Under - 19 Cricket World Cup , and the third to be held in New Zealand ( after the 2002 and 2010 events ) . New Zealand was the first country to host the event three times . The opening ceremony took place on 7 January 2018 . The West Indies were the defending champions . However , they failed to defend their title , after losing their first two group fixtures . </P>\n<P> Scoring over 10,000 runs across a playing career in any format of cricket is considered a significant achievement . In the year 2001 , Sachin Tendulkar became the first player to score 10,000 runs in ODIs , while playing a match during the bi-lateral series against Australia at home . In the chase for achieving top scores , West Indies ' Desmond Haynes retired as the most prolific run - scorer in One Day Internationals ( ODIs ) , with a total of 8,648 runs in 1994 . The record stood for four years until it was broken by India 's Mohammed Azharuddin . Azharuddin remained the top - scorer in the format until his compatriot Sachin Tendulkar passed him in October 2000 . As of August 2016 , eleven players -- from six teams that are Full members of the International Cricket Council -- have scored more than 10,000 runs in ODIs . Four of these are from Sri Lanka and three from India . The rest are one player each from Pakistan , Australia , West Indies , and South Africa . Bangladesh , England , New Zealand , and Zimbabwe are yet to have a player reach the 10,000 - run mark in this format . </P>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nassistant\n(\nto\nragproxyagent\n)\n:\nI'm sorry, I couldn't find any information about who has been honoured with the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World award for 2016.

The award announcement acknowledged the fact that `` the world 's nine nuclear - armed powers and their allies '' neither signed nor supported the treaty - based prohibition known as the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons or nuclear ban treaty , yet in an interview Committee Chair Berit Reiss - Andersen told reporters that the award was intended to give `` encouragement to all players in the field '' to disarm . The award was hailed by civil society as well as governmental and intergovernmental representatives who support the nuclear ban treaty , but drew criticism from those opposed . At the Nobel Peace Prize award ceremony held in Oslo City Hall on December 10 , 2017 , Setsuko Thurlow , an 85 - year - old survivor of the 1945 atomic bombing of Hiroshima , and ICAN Executive Director Beatrice Fihn jointly received a medal and diploma of the award on behalf of ICAN and delivered the Nobel lecture . </P>\n<P> Career records for batting average are usually subject to a minimum qualification of 20 innings played or completed , in order to exclude batsmen who have not played enough games for their skill to be reliably assessed . Under this qualification , the highest Test batting average belongs to Australia 's Sir Donald Bradman , with 99.94 . Given that a career batting average over 50 is exceptional , and that only five other players have averages over 60 , this is an outstanding statistic . The fact that Bradman 's average is so far above that of any other cricketer has led several statisticians to argue that , statistically at least , he was the greatest athlete in any sport . </P>\n<Table> <Tr> <Th colspan=\"4\"> Indian cricket team in South Africa in 2017 -- 18 </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> </Th> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> </Th> <Td> South Africa </Td> <Td> India </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Dates </Th> <Td colspan=\"3\"> 5 January 2018 -- 24 February 2018 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Captains </Th> <Td> Faf du Plessis ( Tests and ODIs ) JP Duminy ( T20Is ) </Td> <Td> Virat Kohli </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th colspan=\"4\"> Test series </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Result </Th> <Td colspan=\"3\"> South Africa won the 3 - match series 2 -- 1 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Most runs </Th> <Td> AB de Villiers ( 211 ) </Td> <Td> Virat Kohli ( 286 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Most wickets </Th> <Td> Vernon Philander ( 15 ) Kagiso Rabada ( 15 ) </Td> <Td> Mohammed Shami ( 15 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Player of the series </Th> <Td colspan=\"3\"> Vernon Philander ( SA ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th colspan=\"4\"> One Day International series </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Results </Th> <Td colspan=\"3\"> India won the 6 - match series 5 -- 1 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Most runs </Th> <Td> Hashim Amla ( 154 ) </Td> <Td> Virat Kohli ( 558 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Most wickets </Th> <Td> Lungi Ngidi ( 8 ) </Td> <Td> Kuldeep Yadav ( 17 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Player of the series </Th> <Td colspan=\"3\"> Virat Kohli ( Ind ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th colspan=\"4\"> Twenty20 International series </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Results </Th> <Td colspan=\"3\"> India won the 3 - match series 2 -- 1 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Most runs </Th> <Td> JP Duminy ( 122 ) </Td> <Td> Shikhar Dhawan ( 143 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Most wickets </Th> <Td> Junior Dala ( 7 ) </Td> <Td> Bhuvneshwar Kumar ( 7 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Player of the series </Th> <Td colspan=\"3\"> Bhuvneshwar Kumar ( Ind ) </Td> </Tr> </Table>\n<P> Brian Lara took the least number of innings ( 195 ) to reach the 10,000 run mark , later equalled by Sachin Tendulkar and Kumar Sangakkara , while Australia 's Steve Waugh took 244 innings to achieve the feat .

Taussig of USS Bennington landed on Wake and formally took possession of the island for the United States . After a 21 - gun salute , the flag was raised and a brass plate was affixed to the flagstaff with the following inscription : </P>\n<Li> 1960 Flag with 50 stars ( Hawaii ) </Li>\n<P> The flag of the United States of America , often referred to as the American flag , is the national flag of the United States . It consists of thirteen equal horizontal stripes of red ( top and bottom ) alternating with white , with a blue rectangle in the canton ( referred to specifically as the `` union '' ) bearing fifty small , white , five - pointed stars arranged in nine offset horizontal rows , where rows of six stars ( top and bottom ) alternate with rows of five stars . The 50 stars on the flag represent the 50 states of the United States of America , and the 13 stripes represent the thirteen British colonies that declared independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain , and became the first states in the U.S. Nicknames for the flag include The Stars and Stripes , Old Glory , and The Star - Spangled Banner . </P>\n<P> The Pledge of Allegiance of the United States is an expression of allegiance to the Flag of the United States and the republic of the United States of America . It was originally composed by Captain George Thatcher Balch , a Union Army Officer during the Civil War and later a teacher of patriotism in New York City schools . The form of the pledge used today was largely devised by Francis Bellamy in 1892 , and formally adopted by Congress as the pledge in 1942 . The official name of The Pledge of Allegiance was adopted in 1945 . The most recent alteration of its wording came on Flag Day in 1954 , when the words `` under God '' were added . </P>\n<P> In modern times , the U.S. military plays ( or sounds ) `` Reveille '' in the morning , generally near sunrise , though its exact time varies from base to base . On U.S. Army posts and Air Force bases , `` Reveille '' is played by itself or followed by the bugle call `` To the Colors '' at which time the national flag is raised and all U.S. military personnel outdoors are required to come to attention and present a salute in uniform , either to the flag or in the direction of the music if the flag is not visible . While in formation , soldiers are brought to the position of parade rest while `` Reveille '' plays then called to attention and present arms as the national flag is raised . On board U.S. Navy , Marine Corps , and Coast Guard facilities , the flag is generally raised at 0800 ( 8 am ) while `` The Star Spangled Banner '' or the bugle call `` To the Colors '' is played . On some U.S. military bases , `` Reveille '' is accompanied by a cannon shot . </P>\n<P> When the National Anthem was first recognized by law in 1932 , there was no prescription as to behavior during its playing . On June 22 , 1942 , the law was revised indicating that those in uniform should salute during its playing , while others should simply stand at attention , men removing their hats . ( The same code also required that women should place their hands over their hearts when the flag is displayed during the playing of the Anthem , but not if the flag was not present . ) On December 23 , 1942 the law was again revised instructing men and women to stand at attention and face in the direction of the music when it was played . That revision also directed men and women to place their hands over their hearts only if the flag was displayed . Those in uniform were required to salute . On July 7 , 1976 , the law was simplified . Men and women were instructed to stand with their hands over their hearts , men removing their hats , irrespective of whether or not the flag was displayed and those in uniform saluting . On August 12 , 1998 , the law was rewritten keeping the same instructions , but differentiating between `` those in uniform '' and `` members of the Armed Forces and veterans '' who were both instructed to salute during the playing whether or not the flag was displayed . Because of the changes in law over the years and confusion between instructions for the Pledge of Allegence versus the National Anthem , throughout most of the 20th century many people simply stood at attention or with their hands folded in front of them during the playing of the Anthem , and when reciting the Pledge they would hold their hand ( or hat ) over their heart . After 9 / 11 , the custom of placing the hand over the heart during the playing of the Anthem became nearly universal . </P>\n<P> A flag designed by John McConnell in 1969 for the first Earth Day is a dark blue field charged with The Blue Marble , a famous NASA photo of the Earth as seen from outer space . The first edition of McConnell 's flag used screen - printing and used different colors : ocean and land were blue and the clouds were white . McConnell presented his flag to the United Nations as a symbol for consideration . </P>\n<P> The torch - bearing arm was displayed at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876 , and in Madison Square Park in Manhattan from 1876 to 1882 . Fundraising proved difficult , especially for the Americans , and by 1885 work on the pedestal was threatened by lack of funds . Publisher Joseph Pulitzer , of the New York World , started a drive for donations to finish the project and attracted more than 120,000 contributors , most of whom gave less than a dollar . The statue was built in France , shipped overseas in crates , and assembled on the completed pedestal on what was then called Bedloe 's Island . The statue 's completion was marked by New York 's first ticker - tape parade and a dedication ceremony presided over by President Grover Cleveland . </P>\n<P> The horizontal stripes on the flag represent the nine original departments of Uruguay , based on the U.S flag , where the stripes represent the original 13 colonies . The first flag designed in 1828 had 9 light blue stripes ; this number was reduced to 4 in 1830 due to visibility problems from distance . The Sun of May represents the May Revolution of 1810 ; according to the historian Diego Abad de Santillán , the Sun of May is a figurative sun that represents Inti , the sun god of the Inca religion . It also appears in the Flag of Argentina and the Coat of Arms of Bolivia . </P>\n<P> The anthem has been recorded and performed in many different languages , usually as a result of the hosting of either form of the Games in various countries . The IOC does n't require that the anthem be performed in either English or Greek . But in the 2008 Olympic opening and closing ceremonies in Beijing , China , Greek was sung instead of the host country 's official language , Mandarin . Also in the 2016 Olympic opening ceremonies in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , English was also sung instead of host country 's official language , Portuguese . </P>\n<P> The United States Oath of Allegiance , officially referred to as the `` Oath of Allegiance , '' 8 C.F.R. Part 337 ( 2008 ) , is an allegiance oath that must be taken by all immigrants who wish to become United States citizens . </P>\n<P> During the first half of the 19th century , seven stars were added to the flag to represent the seven signatories to the Venezuelan declaration of independence , being the provinces of Caracas , Cumaná , Barcelona , Barinas , Margarita , Mérida , and Trujillo . </P>\n<P> With the annexation of Hawaii in 1898 and the seizure of Guam and the Philippines during the Spanish -- American War that same year , the United States began to consider unclaimed and uninhabited Wake Island , located approximately halfway between Honolulu and Manila , as a good location for a telegraph cable station and coaling station for refueling warships of the rapidly expanding United States Navy and passing merchant and passenger steamships . On July 4 , 1898 , United States Army Brigadier General Francis V. Greene of the 2nd Brigade , Philippine Expeditionary Force , of the Eighth Army Corps , stopped at Wake Island and raised the American flag while en route to the Philippines on the steamship liner SS China . </P>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nassistant\n(\nto\nragproxyagent\n)\n:\nI don't have the answer with the provided context.

This\nframework allows tool use and human participation through multi-agent\nconversation. Please find documentation about this feature\nhere\n.\n\nIn traditional ML pipeline, we train a model by updating its parameter\naccording to the loss on the training set, while in the era of LLM\nagents, how should we train an agent? Here, we take an initial step\ntowards the agent training. Inspired by the\nfunction\ncalling\ncapabilities provided by OpenAI, we draw an analogy between model\nparameters and agent functions/skills, and update agent’s\nfunctions/skills based on its historical performance on the training\nset. As an agentic way of training an agent, our approach help enhance\nthe agents’ abilities without requiring access to the LLMs parameters.\n\nIn this notebook, we introduce a new class, ‘AgentOptimizer’, which is\nable to improve the function list of one Assistant-UserProxy pair\naccording to the historical conversation histories. This feature would\nsupport agents in improving their ability to solve problems of the same\ntype as previous tasks. Specifically, given a set of training data,\nAgentOptimizer would iteratively prompt the LLM to optimize the existing\nfunction list of the AssistantAgent and UserProxyAgent with code\nimplementation if necessary. It also includes two strategies, roll-back,\nand early-stop, to streamline the training process. In the example\nscenario, we test the proposed AgentOptimizer in solving problems from\nthe\nMATH dataset\n.\n\nMore information could be found in the\npaper\n.\n\nAuthors: -\nShaokun Zhang\n, Ph.D. student\nat the The Pennsylvania State University -\nJieyu\nZhang\n, Ph.D. student at the University of\nWashington"

Two companies that stood out during this period were META and TESLA.\nMETA, the social media giant, had an average stock price of [META Mean] during this period. The highest it reached was [META Max], while the lowest was [META Min]. The standard deviation, a measure of how spread out the prices were, was [META Std].\nOn the other hand, TESLA, the electric vehicle and clean energy company, had an average stock price of [TESLA Mean]. The stock reached a high of [TESLA Max] and a low of [TESLA Min]. The standard deviation for TESLA was [TESLA Std].\nThese figures show that both META and TESLA had their ups and downs during this period. However, the higher standard deviation for [Company with higher Std] indicates that its stock price fluctuated more compared to [Company with lower Std].\nAs we move further into 2024, it will be interesting to see how these trends evolve. Will META and TESLA continue on their current trajectories, or will we see a shift in the market dynamics? Only time will tell.\n---\nPlease replace [META Mean], [META Max], [META Min], [META Std], [TESLA Mean], [TESLA Max], [TESLA Min], [TESLA Std], [Company with higher Std], and [Company with lower Std] with the actual values obtained from the Python code.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n>>>>>>>> EXECUTING CODE BLOCK (inferred language is python)...\nuser_proxy\n(\nto\nassistant\n)\n:\nexitcode: 0 (execution succeeded)\nCode output: META - Mean: 403.53000895182294, Max: 519.8300170898438, Min: 344.4700012207031, Std: 100.72287240911488\nTESLA - Mean: 219.54332987467447, Max: 248.4199981689453, Min: 171.75999450683594, Std: 41.68075797345465\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nassistant\n(\nto\nuser_proxy\n)\n:\nGreat!

Press enter to skip and use auto-reply, or type 'exit' to end the conversation:  ValueError: The truth value of a Series is ambiguous.\nAdmin\n(\nto\nchat_manager\n)\n:\nValueError: The truth value of a Series is ambiguous.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEngineer\n(\nto\nchat_manager\n)\n:\nThe error message indicates that the comparison operation is being performed on a pandas Series object, which is ambiguous. This is likely because the `calculate_daily_spread` function is returning a Series object instead of a single value.\nTo fix this, we need to ensure that the `calculate_daily_spread` function returns a single value. We can do this by taking the first (and only) value from the Series object.\nHere is the plan of changes:\n1. Modify the `calculate_daily_spread` function in `spread_calculation.py` to return only the first value from the `spread` Series.\n2. No changes are required in `main.py` as the returned value from `calculate_daily_spread` function will now be a single value.\nPlease confirm if this plan is correct and I can proceed with the changes.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nProvide feedback to chat_manager.

Designed to facilitate advanced automated theorem proving\nat the IMO level, FIMO is currently tailored for the Lean formal language. It\ncomprises 149 formal problem statements, accompanied by both informal problem\ndescriptions and their corresponding LaTeX-based informal proofs. Through\ninitial experiments involving GPT-4, our findings underscore the existing\nlimitations in current methodologies, indicating a substantial journey ahead\nbefore achieving satisfactory IMO-level automated theorem proving outcomes.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nProduct_manager\n(\nto\nchat_manager\n)\n:\nBased on the paper titled \"FIMO: A Challenge Formal Dataset for Automated Theorem Proving\" and its summary, the potential applications of GPT-4 in software development can be related to the field of automated theorem proving.\n1. **Automated theorem proving**: GPT-4 can be utilized in the development of automated theorem proving software that attempts to prove complex mathematical problems taken from International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) or other challenging sources. By fine-tuning GPT-4 with a dataset like FIMO consisting of formal mathematical problems, the model can potentially better understand the problem statements and generate appropriate proofs.\n2. **Mathematical problem-solving assistants**: Software tools can be developed using GPT-4 to guide users in solving complex mathematical problems. The AI model can be integrated into educational platforms, online math tutoring services, or even standalone tools to help make solving problems easier and faster for students and professionals alike.\n3. **Formal language translation**: GPT-4 can potentially be integrated into software for translating between formal languages, assisting in the understanding and comparison of various formal systems. This would be especially useful in research communities employing different formal languages and wanting to share ideas and results.\n4. **Mathematical proof checking**: GPT-4 can be employed in proof-checking software to identify and correct inconsistencies. By improving the correctness of proofs, this application would ultimately help users save time and contribute to the overall quality of mathematical research.\nPlease note that this paper highlights the current limitations of GPT-4 in the context of IMO-level theorem proving. Nevertheless, these potential applications suggest directions for further research and software development as the model and related techniques continue to improve.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n>>>>>>>> USING AUTO REPLY...\nUser_proxy\n(\nto\nchat_manager\n)\n:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n>>>>>>>> USING AUTO REPLY...\nUser_proxy\n(\nto\nchat_manager\n)\n:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCoder\n(\nto\nchat_manager\n)\n:\nTERMINATE\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

You can install the required packages using pip if they are not already installed:\n```python\n!pip install flaml pyspark joblib-spark\n```\nHere's a sample code snippet that demonstrates how to use FLAML with Spark for parallel training:\n```python\nfrom flaml import AutoML\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_digits\nfrom joblibspark import register_spark\n# Initialize a Spark session\nspark = SparkSession.builder \\\n.master(\"local[*]\") \\\n.appName(\"FLAML_Spark_Example\") \\\n.getOrCreate()\n# Register the joblib spark backend\nregister_spark()  # This registers the backend for parallel processing\n# Load sample data\nX, y = load_digits(return_X_y=True)\n# Initialize an AutoML instance\nautoml = AutoML()\n# Define the settings for the AutoML run\nsettings = {\n\"time_budget\": 60,  # Total running time in seconds\n\"metric\": 'accuracy',  # Primary metric for evaluation\n\"task\": 'classification',  # Task type\n\"n_jobs\": -1,  # Number of jobs to run in parallel (use -1 for all)\n\"estimator_list\": ['lgbm', 'rf', 'xgboost'],  # List of estimators to consider\n\"log_file_name\": \"flaml_log.txt\",  # Log file name\n}\n# Run the AutoML search with Spark backend\nautoml.fit(X_train=X, y_train=y, **settings)\n# Output the best model and its performance\nprint(f\"Best ML model: {automl.model}\")\nprint(f\"Best ML model's accuracy: {automl.best_loss}\")\n# Stop the Spark session\nspark.stop()\n```\nThe `register_spark()` function from `joblib-spark` is used to register the Spark backend with joblib, which is utilized for parallel training within FLAML. The `n_jobs=-1` parameter tells FLAML to use all available Spark executors for parallel training.\nPlease note that the actual process of setting up a Spark cluster can be complex and might involve additional steps such as configuring Spark workers, allocating resources, and more, which are beyond the scope of this code snippet.\nIf you encounter any issues or need to adjust configurations for your specific Spark setup, please refer to the Spark and FLAML documentation for more details.\nWhen you run the code, ensure that your Spark cluster is properly configured and accessible from your Python environment. Adjust the `.master(\"local[*]\")` to point to your Spark master's URL if you are running a cluster that is not local.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTo use Spark for parallel training in FLAML (Fast and Lightweight AutoML), you would need to set up a Spark cluster and utilize the `spark` backend for joblib, which FLAML uses internally for parallel training.

Give me sample code.\nContext is: # Integrate - Spark\nFLAML has integrated Spark for distributed training. There are two main aspects of integration with Spark:\n- Use Spark ML estimators for AutoML.\n- Use Spark to run training in parallel spark jobs.\n## Spark ML Estimators\nFLAML integrates estimators based on Spark ML models. These models are trained in parallel using Spark, so we called them Spark estimators. To use these models, you first need to organize your data in the required format.\n### Data\nFor Spark estimators, AutoML only consumes Spark data. FLAML provides a convenient function `to_pandas_on_spark` in the `flaml.automl.spark.utils` module to convert your data into a pandas-on-spark (`pyspark.pandas`) dataframe/series, which Spark estimators require.\nThis utility function takes data in the form of a `pandas.Dataframe` or `pyspark.sql.Dataframe` and converts it into a pandas-on-spark dataframe. It also takes `pandas.Series` or `pyspark.sql.Dataframe` and converts it into a [pandas-on-spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/index.html) series. If you pass in a `pyspark.pandas.Dataframe`, it will not make any changes.\nThis function also accepts optional arguments `index_col` and `default_index_type`.\n- `index_col` is the column name to use as the index, default is None.\n- `default_index_type` is the default index type, default is \"distributed-sequence\". More info about default index type could be found on Spark official [documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/options.html#default-index-type)\nHere is an example code snippet for Spark Data:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom flaml.automl.spark.utils import to_pandas_on_spark\n# Creating a dictionary\ndata = {\n\"Square_Feet\": [800, 1200, 1800, 1500, 850],\n\"Age_Years\": [20, 15, 10, 7, 25],\n\"Price\": [100000, 200000, 300000, 240000, 120000],\n}\n# Creating a pandas DataFrame\ndataframe = pd.DataFrame(data)\nlabel = \"Price\"\n# Convert to pandas-on-spark dataframe\npsdf = to_pandas_on_spark(dataframe)\n```\nTo use Spark ML models you need to format your data appropriately. Specifically, use [`VectorAssembler`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.ml.feature.VectorAssembler.html) to merge all feature columns into a single vector column.\nHere is an example of how to use it:\n```python\nfrom pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler\ncolumns = psdf.columns\nfeature_cols = [col for col in columns if col != label]\nfeaturizer = VectorAssembler(inputCols=feature_cols, outputCol=\"features\")\npsdf = featurizer.transform(psdf.to_spark(index_col=\"index\"))[\"index\", \"features\"]\n```\nLater in conducting the experiment, use your pandas-on-spark data like non-spark data and pass them using `X_train, y_train` or `dataframe, label`.\n### Estimators\n#### Model List\n- `lgbm_spark`: The class for fine-tuning Spark version LightGBM models, using [SynapseML](https://microsoft.github.io/SynapseML/docs/features/lightgbm/about/) API.\n#### Usage\nFirst, prepare your data in the required format as described in the previous section.\nBy including the models you intend to try in the `estimators_list` argument to `flaml.automl`, FLAML will start trying configurations for these models. If your input is Spark data, FLAML will also use estimators with the `_spark` postfix by default, even if you haven't specified them.\nHere is an example code snippet using SparkML models in AutoML:\n```python\nimport flaml\n# prepare your data in pandas-on-spark format as we previously mentioned\nautoml = flaml.AutoML()\nsettings = {\n\"time_budget\": 30,\n\"metric\": \"r2\",\n\"estimator_list\": [\"lgbm_spark\"],  # this setting is optional\n\"task\": \"regression\",\n}\nautoml.fit(\ndataframe=psdf,\nlabel=label,\n**settings,\n)\n```\n[Link to notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/automl_bankrupt_synapseml.ipynb) | [Open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/automl_bankrupt_synapseml.ipynb)\n## Parallel Spark Jobs\nYou can activate Spark as the parallel backend during parallel tuning in both [AutoML](/docs/Use-Cases/Task-Oriented-AutoML#parallel-tuning) and [Hyperparameter Tuning](/docs/Use-Cases/Tune-User-Defined-Function#parallel-tuning), by setting the `use_spark` to `true`. FLAML will dispatch your job to the distributed Spark backend using [`joblib-spark`](https://github.com/joblib/joblib-spark).\nPlease note that you should not set `use_spark` to `true` when applying AutoML and Tuning for Spark Data. This is because only SparkML models will be used for Spark Data in AutoML and Tuning. As SparkML models run in parallel, there is no need to distribute them with `use_spark` again.\nAll the Spark-related arguments are stated below. These arguments are available in both Hyperparameter Tuning and AutoML:\n- `use_spark`: boolean, default=False | Whether to use spark to run the training in parallel spark jobs. This can be used to accelerate training on large models and large datasets, but will incur more overhead in time and thus slow down training in some cases. GPU training is not supported yet when use_spark is True. For Spark clusters, by default, we will launch one trial per executor. However, sometimes we want to launch more trials than the number of executors (e.g., local mode). In this case, we can set the environment variable `FLAML_MAX_CONCURRENT` to override the detected `num_executors`. The final number of concurrent trials will be the minimum of `n_concurrent_trials` and `num_executors`.\n- `n_concurrent_trials`: int, default=1 | The number of concurrent trials. When n_concurrent_trials > 1, FLAML performes parallel tuning.\n- `force_cancel`: boolean, default=False | Whether to forcely cancel Spark jobs if the search time exceeded the time budget. Spark jobs include parallel tuning jobs and Spark-based model training jobs.\nAn example code snippet for using parallel Spark jobs:\n```python\nimport flaml\nautoml_experiment = flaml.AutoML()\nautoml_settings = {\n\"time_budget\": 30,\n\"metric\": \"r2\",\n\"task\": \"regression\",\n\"n_concurrent_trials\": 2,\n\"use_spark\": True,\n\"force_cancel\": True,  # Activating the force_cancel option can immediately halt Spark jobs once they exceed the allocated time_budget.\n}\nautoml.fit(\ndataframe=dataframe,\nlabel=label,\n**automl_settings,\n)\n```\n[Link to notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/integrate_spark.ipynb) | [Open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/integrate_spark.ipynb)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBoss_Assistant\n(\nto\nchat_manager\n)\n:\nYou're a retrieve augmented coding assistant.

There are two main aspects of integration with Spark:\n- Use Spark ML estimators for AutoML.\n- Use Spark to run training in parallel spark jobs.\n## Spark ML Estimators\nFLAML integrates estimators based on Spark ML models. These models are trained in parallel using Spark, so we called them Spark estimators. To use these models, you first need to organize your data in the required format.\n### Data\nFor Spark estimators, AutoML only consumes Spark data. FLAML provides a convenient function `to_pandas_on_spark` in the `flaml.automl.spark.utils` module to convert your data into a pandas-on-spark (`pyspark.pandas`) dataframe/series, which Spark estimators require.\nThis utility function takes data in the form of a `pandas.Dataframe` or `pyspark.sql.Dataframe` and converts it into a pandas-on-spark dataframe. It also takes `pandas.Series` or `pyspark.sql.Dataframe` and converts it into a [pandas-on-spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/index.html) series. If you pass in a `pyspark.pandas.Dataframe`, it will not make any changes.\nThis function also accepts optional arguments `index_col` and `default_index_type`.\n- `index_col` is the column name to use as the index, default is None.\n- `default_index_type` is the default index type, default is \"distributed-sequence\". More info about default index type could be found on Spark official [documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/options.html#default-index-type)\nHere is an example code snippet for Spark Data:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom flaml.automl.spark.utils import to_pandas_on_spark\n# Creating a dictionary\ndata = {\n\"Square_Feet\": [800, 1200, 1800, 1500, 850],\n\"Age_Years\": [20, 15, 10, 7, 25],\n\"Price\": [100000, 200000, 300000, 240000, 120000],\n}\n# Creating a pandas DataFrame\ndataframe = pd.DataFrame(data)\nlabel = \"Price\"\n# Convert to pandas-on-spark dataframe\npsdf = to_pandas_on_spark(dataframe)\n```\nTo use Spark ML models you need to format your data appropriately. Specifically, use [`VectorAssembler`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.ml.feature.VectorAssembler.html) to merge all feature columns into a single vector column.\nHere is an example of how to use it:\n```python\nfrom pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler\ncolumns = psdf.columns\nfeature_cols = [col for col in columns if col != label]\nfeaturizer = VectorAssembler(inputCols=feature_cols, outputCol=\"features\")\npsdf = featurizer.transform(psdf.to_spark(index_col=\"index\"))[\"index\", \"features\"]\n```\nLater in conducting the experiment, use your pandas-on-spark data like non-spark data and pass them using `X_train, y_train` or `dataframe, label`.\n### Estimators\n#### Model List\n- `lgbm_spark`: The class for fine-tuning Spark version LightGBM models, using [SynapseML](https://microsoft.github.io/SynapseML/docs/features/lightgbm/about/) API.\n#### Usage\nFirst, prepare your data in the required format as described in the previous section.\nBy including the models you intend to try in the `estimators_list` argument to `flaml.automl`, FLAML will start trying configurations for these models. If your input is Spark data, FLAML will also use estimators with the `_spark` postfix by default, even if you haven't specified them.\nHere is an example code snippet using SparkML models in AutoML:\n```python\nimport flaml\n# prepare your data in pandas-on-spark format as we previously mentioned\nautoml = flaml.AutoML()\nsettings = {\n\"time_budget\": 30,\n\"metric\": \"r2\",\n\"estimator_list\": [\"lgbm_spark\"],  # this setting is optional\n\"task\": \"regression\",\n}\nautoml.fit(\ndataframe=psdf,\nlabel=label,\n**settings,\n)\n```\n[Link to notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/automl_bankrupt_synapseml.ipynb) | [Open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/automl_bankrupt_synapseml.ipynb)\n## Parallel Spark Jobs\nYou can activate Spark as the parallel backend during parallel tuning in both [AutoML](/docs/Use-Cases/Task-Oriented-AutoML#parallel-tuning) and [Hyperparameter Tuning](/docs/Use-Cases/Tune-User-Defined-Function#parallel-tuning), by setting the `use_spark` to `true`. FLAML will dispatch your job to the distributed Spark backend using [`joblib-spark`](https://github.com/joblib/joblib-spark).\nPlease note that you should not set `use_spark` to `true` when applying AutoML and Tuning for Spark Data. This is because only SparkML models will be used for Spark Data in AutoML and Tuning. As SparkML models run in parallel, there is no need to distribute them with `use_spark` again.\nAll the Spark-related arguments are stated below. These arguments are available in both Hyperparameter Tuning and AutoML:\n- `use_spark`: boolean, default=False | Whether to use spark to run the training in parallel spark jobs. This can be used to accelerate training on large models and large datasets, but will incur more overhead in time and thus slow down training in some cases. GPU training is not supported yet when use_spark is True. For Spark clusters, by default, we will launch one trial per executor. However, sometimes we want to launch more trials than the number of executors (e.g., local mode). In this case, we can set the environment variable `FLAML_MAX_CONCURRENT` to override the detected `num_executors`. The final number of concurrent trials will be the minimum of `n_concurrent_trials` and `num_executors`.\n- `n_concurrent_trials`: int, default=1 | The number of concurrent trials. When n_concurrent_trials > 1, FLAML performes parallel tuning.\n- `force_cancel`: boolean, default=False | Whether to forcely cancel Spark jobs if the search time exceeded the time budget. Spark jobs include parallel tuning jobs and Spark-based model training jobs.\nAn example code snippet for using parallel Spark jobs:\n```python\nimport flaml\nautoml_experiment = flaml.AutoML()\nautoml_settings = {\n\"time_budget\": 30,\n\"metric\": \"r2\",\n\"task\": \"regression\",\n\"n_concurrent_trials\": 2,\n\"use_spark\": True,\n\"force_cancel\": True,  # Activating the force_cancel option can immediately halt Spark jobs once they exceed the allocated time_budget.\n}\nautoml.fit(\ndataframe=dataframe,\nlabel=label,\n**automl_settings,\n)\n```\n[Link to notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/integrate_spark.ipynb) | [Open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/integrate_spark.ipynb)\n*************************************************************\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBoss\n(\nto\nchat_manager\n)\n:\n***** Response from calling function (retrieve_content) *****\nYou're a retrieve augmented coding assistant.

In\nthis work, we investigate the potential of large language models to generate\npatient summaries based on doctors' notes and study the effect of training data\non the faithfulness and quality of the generated summaries. To this end, we\ndevelop a rigorous labeling protocol for hallucinations, and have two medical\nexperts annotate 100 real-world summaries and 100 generated summaries. We show\nthat fine-tuning on hallucination-free data effectively reduces hallucinations\nfrom 2.60 to 1.55 per summary for Llama 2, while preserving relevant\ninformation. Although the effect is still present, it is much smaller for GPT-4\nwhen prompted with five examples (0.70 to 0.40). We also conduct a qualitative\nevaluation using hallucination-free and improved training data. GPT-4 shows\nvery good results even in the zero-shot setting. We find that common\nquantitative metrics do not correlate well with faithfulness and quality.\nFinally, we test GPT-4 for automatic hallucination detection, which yields\npromising results.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nScientist\n(\nto\nchat_manager\n)\n:\nBased on the abstract provided, the paper titled \"A Data-Centric Approach To Generate Faithful and High Quality Patient Summaries with Large Language Models\" explores the use of large language models, including GPT-4, to generate patient summaries from doctors' notes. The study focuses on the impact of training data on the faithfulness and quality of the generated summaries and also investigates the potential of GPT-4 for automatic hallucination detection.\n**Potential Applications in Software:**\n1. **Healthcare Documentation Automation:**\n- GPT-4 could be used to develop software that assists healthcare professionals in creating accurate and comprehensive patient summaries by automatically processing doctors' notes and other medical records.\n2. **Clinical Decision Support Systems:**\n- Integrating GPT-4 into clinical decision support systems could provide healthcare workers with insights and suggestions based on a patient's medical history, potentially improving diagnosis and treatment planning.\n3. **Patient Education and Communication:**\n- Software applications could leverage GPT-4 to translate complex medical information into patient-friendly summaries, enhancing patient understanding of their health conditions and treatments.\n4. **Medical Training and Simulation:**\n- GPT-4 could be used to create realistic medical scenarios for training medical students and professionals, simulating patient interactions and generating case studies.\n5. **Data Quality Assurance:**\n- The paper suggests that GPT-4 can be used for automatic hallucination detection, which refers to the identification of inaccuracies or fabrications in generated text. This could be applied to software that ensures the quality and reliability of medical documentation.\n6. **Research and Development:**\n- GPT-4 could assist researchers in summarizing and synthesizing large volumes of medical literature, aiding in the discovery of new insights and the development of novel treatments.\n7. **Personalized Health Monitoring:**\n- Software applications could use GPT-4 to provide personalized health monitoring and advice by analyzing user input, such as symptoms or lifestyle factors, and generating tailored health recommendations.\nThese potential applications highlight the versatility of GPT-4 in the realm of healthcare software, offering opportunities to enhance patient care, improve healthcare workflows, and support medical education and research.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAdmin\n(\nto\nchat_manager\n)\n:\nTERMINATE\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

However, I can help you write a Python script that uses the arXiv API to fetch the data you need.\nHere's a Python script that uses the `arxiv` package to search for papers related to \"LLM applications\" from the last week. This script will print out the title, authors, summary, and URL of each paper.\n```python\nimport arxiv\nimport datetime\n# Calculate the date one week ago\none_week_ago = (datetime.datetime.now() - datetime.timedelta(days=7)).strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M%S')\n# Search for papers on LLM applications\nsearch = arxiv.Search(\nquery=\"LLM applications\",\nmax_results=100,\nsort_by=arxiv.SortCriterion.SubmittedDate,\nsort_order=arxiv.SortOrder.Descending\n)\nfor result in search.get():\n# Check if the paper was submitted in the last week\nif result.submitted.strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M%S') > one_week_ago:\nprint(f\"Title: {result.title}\")\nprint(f\"Authors: {', '.join(author.name for author in result.authors)}\")\nprint(f\"Summary: {result.summary}\")\nprint(f\"URL: {result.entry_id}\")\nprint(\"\\n\")\n```\nYou can install the `arxiv` package using pip:\n```shell\npip install arxiv\n```\nPlease note that you'll need to replace `\"LLM applications\"` with the actual search term you're interested in. The arXiv API doesn't support searching by the submission date, so the script fetches the 100 most recent results and filters them manually. You may need to increase `max_results` if there are more than 100 papers submitted per week on your topic.\nTo create a markdown table, you'll need to format the output like this:\n```markdown\n| Title | Authors | Summary | URL |\n|\n-------\n|\n---------\n|\n---------\n|\n-----\n|\n| ...   | ...     | ...     | ... |\n```\nYou can do this in Python using f-strings:\n```python\nprint(\"| Title | Authors | Summary | URL |\")\nprint(\"|\n-------\n|\n---------\n|\n---------\n|\n-----\n|\")\nfor result in search.get():\n# Check if the paper was submitted in the last week\nif result.submitted.strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M%S') > one_week_ago:\nprint(f\"| {result.title} | {', '.join(author.name for author in result.authors)} | {result.summary} | {result.entry_id} |\")\n```\nThis will print a markdown table to the console.

Trained on vast amounts of text data, LLMs are capable of\nunderstanding and generating human-like text across a diverse range of topics.\nThis study expands on the applications of LLMs, exploring their potential in\ndata preprocessing, a critical stage in data mining and analytics applications.\nWe delve into the applicability of state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-3.5,\nGPT-4, and Vicuna-13B for error detection, data imputation, schema matching,\nand entity matching tasks. Alongside showcasing the inherent capabilities of\nLLMs, we highlight their limitations, particularly in terms of computational\nexpense and inefficiency. We propose an LLM-based framework for data\npreprocessing, which integrates cutting-edge prompt engineering techniques,\ncoupled with traditional methods like contextualization and feature selection,\nto improve the performance and efficiency of these models. The effectiveness of\nLLMs in data preprocessing is evaluated through an experimental study spanning\n12 datasets. GPT-4 emerged as a standout, achieving 100\\% accuracy or F1 score\non 4 datasets, suggesting LLMs' immense potential in these tasks. Despite\ncertain limitations, our study underscores the promise of LLMs in this domain\nand anticipates future developments to overcome current hurdles. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16361v1 |\n| Large language models in medicine: the potentials and pitfalls | Jesutofunmi A. Omiye, Haiwen Gui, Shawheen J. Rezaei, James Zou, Roxana Daneshjou | Large language models (LLMs) have been applied to tasks in healthcare,\nranging from medical exam questions to responding to patient questions. With\nincreasing institutional partnerships between companies producing LLMs and\nhealthcare systems, real world clinical application is coming closer to\nreality. As these models gain traction, it is essential for healthcare\npractitioners to understand what LLMs are, their development, their current and\npotential applications, and the associated pitfalls when utilized in medicine.\nThis review and accompanying tutorial aim to give an overview of these topics\nto aid healthcare practitioners in understanding the rapidly changing landscape\nof LLMs as applied to medicine. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00087v1 |\n| Point-Bind & Point-LLM: Aligning Point Cloud with Multi-modality for 3D Understanding, Generation, and Instruction Following | Ziyu Guo, Renrui Zhang, Xiangyang Zhu, Yiwen Tang, Xianzheng Ma, Jiaming Han, Kexin Chen, Peng Gao, Xianzhi Li, Hongsheng Li, Pheng-Ann Heng | We introduce Point-Bind, a 3D multi-modality model aligning point clouds with\n2D image, language, audio, and video. Guided by ImageBind, we construct a joint\nembedding space between 3D and multi-modalities, enabling many promising\napplications, e.g., any-to-3D generation, 3D embedding arithmetic, and 3D\nopen-world understanding. On top of this, we further present Point-LLM, the\nfirst 3D large language model (LLM) following 3D multi-modal instructions. By\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, Point-LLM injects the semantics of\nPoint-Bind into pre-trained LLMs, e.g., LLaMA, which requires no 3D instruction\ndata, but exhibits superior 3D and multi-modal question-answering capacity. We\nhope our work may cast a light on the community for extending 3D point clouds\nto multi-modality applications.

Large Language Models as Human Mobility Predictors | Xinglei Wang, Meng Fang, Zichao Zeng, Tao Cheng | Accurate human mobility prediction underpins many important applications\nacross a variety of domains, including epidemic modelling, transport planning,\nand emergency responses. Due to the sparsity of mobility data and the\nstochastic nature of people's daily activities, achieving precise predictions\nof people's locations remains a challenge. While recently developed large\nlanguage models (LLMs) have demonstrated superior performance across numerous\nlanguage-related tasks, their applicability to human mobility studies remains\nunexplored. Addressing this gap, this article delves into the potential of LLMs\nfor human mobility prediction tasks. We introduce a novel method, LLM-Mob,\nwhich leverages the language understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs\nfor analysing human mobility data. We present concepts of historical stays and\ncontext stays to capture both long-term and short-term dependencies in human\nmovement and enable time-aware prediction by using time information of the\nprediction target. Additionally, we design context-inclusive prompts that\nenable LLMs to generate more accurate predictions. Comprehensive evaluations of\nour method reveal that LLM-Mob excels in providing accurate and interpretable\npredictions, highlighting the untapped potential of LLMs in advancing human\nmobility prediction techniques. We posit that our research marks a significant\nparadigm shift in human mobility modelling, transitioning from building complex\ndomain-specific models to harnessing general-purpose LLMs that yield accurate\npredictions through language instructions.

The instructions given to the LLM by natural\nlanguage may include ambiguity and lack of information depending on the task\ncontext. It is possible to adjust the output of LLM by making the instruction\ninput more detailed; however, the design cost is high. In this paper, we\npropose the interactive robot action planning method that allows the LLM to\nanalyze and gather missing information by asking questions to humans. The\nmethod can minimize the design cost of generating precise robot instructions.\nWe demonstrated the effectiveness of our method through concrete examples in\ncooking tasks. However, our experiments also revealed challenges in robot\naction planning with LLM, such as asking unimportant questions and assuming\ncrucial information without asking. Shedding light on these issues provides\nvaluable insights for future research on utilizing LLM for robotics. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15684v1 |\n| AskIt: Unified Programming Interface for Programming with Large Language Models | Katsumi Okuda, Saman Amarasinghe | In the evolving landscape of software development, Large Language Models\n(LLMs) exhibit a unique phenomenon known as emergent abilities, demonstrating\nadeptness across numerous tasks, from text summarization to code generation.\nWhile these abilities open up novel avenues in software design and crafting,\ntheir incorporation presents substantial challenges. Developers grapple with\ndecisions surrounding the direct embedding of LLMs within applications versus\nemploying them for code generation. Moreover, effective prompt design becomes a\ncritical concern, given the necessity of data extraction from natural language\noutputs. To address these intricacies, this paper introduces AskIt, a\ndomain-specific language (DSL) specifically designed for LLMs. AskIt simplifies\nLLM integration, offering type-guided output control, template-based function\ndefinitions, and a unified interface that diminishes the distinction between\nLLM-based code generation and application integration. Furthermore, through\nProgramming by Example (PBE), AskIt harnesses the power of few-shot learning at\nthe programming language level. Our evaluations underscore AskIt's potency.\nAcross 50 tasks, AskIt generated concise prompts for the given tasks, achieving\na 16.14% reduction in prompt length relative to benchmarks. Additionally, by\nenabling the transition from direct LLM application usage to function\ngeneration, AskIt achieved significant speedups, as observed in our GSM8K\nbenchmark experiments. Through these advancements, AskIt streamlines the\nintegration of LLMs in software development, offering a more efficient,\nversatile approach for leveraging emergent abilities. The implementations of\nAskIt in TypeScript and Python are available at\nhttps://github.com/katsumiok/ts-askit and https://github.com/katsumiok/pyaskit,\nrespectively. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15645v1 |\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nScientist\n(\nto\nchat_manager\n)\n:\nHere are the papers related to LLM applications published in the last week:\n| Domain | Title | Authors | Summary | URL |\n|\n-------\n|\n---------\n|\n---------\n|\n-----\n|\n-----\n|\n| Data Preprocessing | [Large Language Models as Data Preprocessors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16361v1) | Haochen Zhang, Yuyang Dong, Chuan Xiao, Masafumi Oyamada | This study expands on the applications of LLMs, exploring their potential in data preprocessing, a critical stage in data mining and analytics applications. | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16361v1) |\n| Medicine | [Large language models in medicine: the potentials and pitfalls](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00087v1) | Jesutofunmi A.

This investigation presents an innovative framework that\nstrategically tailors LLMs for streamlined context processing by harnessing the\nsynergies among natural language summarization, soft prompt compression, and\naugmented utility preservation mechanisms. Our methodology, dubbed\nSoftPromptComp, amalgamates natural language prompts extracted from\nsummarization methodologies with dynamically generated soft prompts to forge a\nconcise yet semantically robust depiction of protracted contexts. This\ndepiction undergoes further refinement via a weighting mechanism optimizing\ninformation retention and utility for subsequent tasks. We substantiate that\nour framework markedly diminishes computational overhead and enhances LLMs'\nefficacy across various benchmarks, while upholding or even augmenting the\ncaliber of the produced content. By amalgamating soft prompt compression with\nsophisticated summarization, SoftPromptComp confronts the dual challenges of\nmanaging lengthy contexts and ensuring model scalability. Our findings point\ntowards a propitious trajectory for augmenting LLMs' applicability and\nefficiency, rendering them more versatile and pragmatic for real-world\napplications. This research enriches the ongoing discourse on optimizing\nlanguage models, providing insights into the potency of soft prompts and\nsummarization techniques as pivotal instruments for the forthcoming generation\nof NLP solutions.\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04997v1\n---\nTitle: Explainable Traffic Flow Prediction with Large Language Models\nAuthors: Xusen Guo, Qiming Zhang, Mingxing Peng, Meixin Zhu, Hao, Yang\nAbstract: Traffic flow prediction is crucial for urban planning, transportation\nmanagement, and infrastructure development. However, achieving both accuracy\nand interpretability in prediction models remains challenging due to the\ncomplexity of traffic data and the inherent opacity of deep learning\nmethodologies. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Traffic Flow\nPrediction LLM (TF-LLM), which leverages large language models (LLMs) to\ngenerate interpretable traffic flow predictions. By transferring multi-modal\ntraffic data into natural language descriptions, TF-LLM captures complex\nspatial-temporal patterns and external factors such as weather conditions,\nPoints of Interest (PoIs), date, and holidays. We fine-tune the LLM framework\nusing language-based instructions to align with spatial-temporal traffic flow\ndata. Our comprehensive multi-modal traffic flow dataset (CATraffic) in\nCalifornia enables the evaluation of TF-LLM against state-of-the-art deep\nlearning baselines. Results demonstrate TF-LLM's competitive accuracy while\nproviding intuitive and interpretable predictions. We discuss the\nspatial-temporal and input dependencies for explainable future flow\nforecasting, showcasing TF-LLM's potential for diverse city prediction tasks.\nThis paper contributes to advancing explainable traffic prediction models and\nlays a foundation for future exploration of LLM applications in transportation.\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02937v2\n---\nTitle: Designing Child-Centric AI Learning Environments: Insights from\nLLM-Enhanced Creative Project-Based Learning\nAuthors: Siyu Zha, Yuehan Qiao, Qingyu Hu, Zhongsheng Li, Jiangtao Gong, Yingqing Xu\nAbstract: Project-based learning (PBL) is an instructional method that is very helpful\nin nurturing students' creativity, but it requires significant time and energy\nfrom both students and teachers. Large language models (LLMs) have been proven\nto assist in creative tasks, yet much controversy exists regarding their role\nin fostering creativity. This paper explores the potential of LLMs in PBL\nsettings, with a special focus on fostering creativity. We began with an\nexploratory study involving 12 middle school students and identified five\ndesign considerations for LLM applications in PBL. Building on this, we\ndeveloped an LLM-empowered, 48-hour PBL program and conducted an instructional\nexperiment with 31 middle school students. Our results indicated that LLMs can\nenhance every stage of PBL. Additionally, we also discovered ambivalent\nperspectives among students and mentors toward LLM usage.

Lawrence, Renee A. Schneider, Susan B. Rubin, Maja J. Mataric, Daniel J. McDuff, Megan Jones Bell\nAbstract: Global rates of mental health concerns are rising and there is increasing\nrealization that existing models of mental healthcare will not adequately\nexpand to meet the demand. With the emergence of large language models (LLMs)\nhas come great optimism regarding their promise to create novel, large-scale\nsolutions to support mental health. Despite their nascence, LLMs have already\nbeen applied to mental health-related tasks. In this review, we summarize the\nextant literature on efforts to use LLMs to provide mental health education,\nassessment, and intervention and highlight key opportunities for positive\nimpact in each area. We then highlight risks associated with LLMs application\nto mental health and encourage adoption of strategies to mitigate these risks.\nThe urgent need for mental health support must be balanced with responsible\ndevelopment, testing, and deployment of mental health LLMs. Especially critical\nis ensuring that mental health LLMs are fine-tuned for mental health, enhance\nmental health equity, adhere to ethical standards, and that people, including\nthose with lived experience with mental health concerns, are involved in all\nstages from development through deployment. Prioritizing these efforts will\nminimize potential harms to mental health and maximize the likelihood that LLMs\nwill positively impact mental health globally.\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14814v2\n---\nTitle: Large Language Models for Blockchain Security: A Systematic Literature\nReview\nAuthors: Zheyuan He, Zihao Li, Sen Yang\nAbstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools in various\ndomains involving blockchain security (BS). Several recent studies are\nexploring LLMs applied to BS. However, there remains a gap in our understanding\nregarding the full scope of applications, impacts, and potential constraints of\nLLMs on blockchain security. To fill this gap, we conduct a literature review\non LLM4BS.\nAs the first review of LLM's application on blockchain security, our study\naims to comprehensively analyze existing research and elucidate how LLMs\ncontribute to enhancing the security of blockchain systems. Through a thorough\nexamination of scholarly works, we delve into the integration of LLMs into\nvarious aspects of blockchain security. We explore the mechanisms through which\nLLMs can bolster blockchain security, including their applications in smart\ncontract auditing, identity verification, anomaly detection, vulnerable repair,\nand so on. Furthermore, we critically assess the challenges and limitations\nassociated with leveraging LLMs for blockchain security, considering factors\nsuch as scalability, privacy concerns, and adversarial attacks. Our review\nsheds light on the opportunities and potential risks inherent in this\nconvergence, providing valuable insights for researchers, practitioners, and\npolicymakers alike.\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14280v2\n---\nTitle: Do Large Language Model Understand Multi-Intent Spoken Language ?\nAuthors: Shangjian Yin, Peijie Huang, Yuhong Xu, Haojing Huang, Jiatian Chen\nAbstract: This study marks a significant advancement by harnessing Large Language\nModels (LLMs) for multi-intent spoken language understanding (SLU), proposing a\nunique methodology that capitalizes on the generative power of LLMs within an\nSLU context. Our innovative technique reconfigures entity slots specifically\nfor LLM application in multi-intent SLU environments and introduces the concept\nof Sub-Intent Instruction (SII), enhancing the dissection and interpretation of\nintricate, multi-intent communication within varied domains. The resultant\ndatasets, dubbed LM-MixATIS and LM-MixSNIPS, are crafted from pre-existing\nbenchmarks. Our research illustrates that LLMs can match and potentially excel\nbeyond the capabilities of current state-of-the-art multi-intent SLU models. It\nfurther explores LLM efficacy across various intent configurations and dataset\nproportions. Moreover, we introduce two pioneering metrics, Entity Slot\nAccuracy (ESA) and Combined Semantic Accuracy (CSA), to provide an in-depth\nanalysis of LLM proficiency in this complex field.\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04481v2\n---\nTitle: Breaking the Language Barrier: Can Direct Inference Outperform\nPre-Translation in Multilingual LLM Applications?\nAuthors: Yotam Intrator, Matan Halfon, Roman Goldenberg, Reut Tsarfaty, Matan Eyal, Ehud Rivlin, Yossi Matias, Natalia Aizenberg\nAbstract: Large language models hold significant promise in multilingual applications.\nHowever, inherent biases stemming from predominantly English-centric\npre-training have led to the widespread practice of pre-translation, i.e.,\ntranslating non-English inputs to English before inference, leading to\ncomplexity and information loss. This study re-evaluates the need for\npre-translation in the context of PaLM2 models (Anil et al., 2023), which have\nbeen established as highly performant in multilingual tasks. We offer a\ncomprehensive investigation across 108 languages and 6 diverse benchmarks,\nincluding open-end generative tasks, which were excluded from previous similar\nstudies. Our findings challenge the pre-translation paradigm established in\nprior research, highlighting the advantages of direct inference in PaLM2.\nSpecifically, PaLM2-L consistently outperforms pre-translation in 94 out of 108\nlanguages. These findings pave the way for more efficient and effective\nmultilingual applications, alleviating the limitations associated with\npre-translation and unlocking linguistic authenticity.\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04792v1\n---\nTitle: SciAssess: Benchmarking LLM Proficiency in Scientific Literature\nAnalysis\nAuthors: Hengxing Cai, Xiaochen Cai, Junhan Chang, Sihang Li, Lin Yao, Changxin Wang, Zhifeng Gao, Hongshuai Wang, Yongge Li, Mujie Lin, Shuwen Yang, Jiankun Wang, Yuqi Yin, Yaqi Li, Linfeng Zhang, Guolin Ke\nAbstract: Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized\nnatural language understanding and generation, igniting a surge of interest in\nleveraging these technologies in the field of scientific literature analysis.\nExisting benchmarks, however, inadequately evaluate the proficiency of LLMs in\nscientific literature analysis, especially in scenarios involving complex\ncomprehension and multimodal data. In response, we introduced SciAssess, a\nbenchmark tailored for the in-depth analysis of scientific literature, crafted\nto provide a thorough assessment of LLMs' efficacy. SciAssess focuses on\nevaluating LLMs' abilities in memorization, comprehension, and analysis within\nthe context of scientific literature analysis. It includes representative tasks\nfrom diverse scientific fields, such as general chemistry, organic materials,\nand alloy materials. And rigorous quality control measures ensure its\nreliability in terms of correctness, anonymization, and copyright compliance.\nSciAssess evaluates leading LLMs, including GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and Gemini,\nidentifying their strengths and aspects for improvement and supporting the\nongoing development of LLM applications in scientific literature analysis.\nSciAssess and its resources are made available at https://sci-assess.github.io,\noffering a valuable tool for advancing LLM capabilities in scientific\nliterature analysis.\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01976v2\n---\nTitle: Differentially Private Synthetic Data via Foundation Model APIs 2: Text\nAuthors: Chulin Xie, Zinan Lin, Arturs Backurs, Sivakanth Gopi, Da Yu, Huseyin A Inan, Harsha Nori, Haotian Jiang, Huishuai Zhang, Yin Tat Lee, Bo Li, Sergey Yekhanin\nAbstract: Text data has become extremely valuable due to the emergence of machine\nlearning algorithms that learn from it. A lot of high-quality text data\ngenerated in the real world is private and therefore cannot be shared or used\nfreely due to privacy concerns. Generating synthetic replicas of private text\ndata with a formal privacy guarantee, i.e., differential privacy (DP), offers a\npromising and scalable solution. However, existing methods necessitate DP\nfinetuning of large language models (LLMs) on private data to generate DP\nsynthetic data. This approach is not viable for proprietary LLMs (e.g.,\nGPT-3.5) and also demands considerable computational resources for open-source\nLLMs. Lin et al. (2024) recently introduced the Private Evolution (PE)\nalgorithm to generate DP synthetic images with only API access to diffusion\nmodels. In this work, we propose an augmented PE algorithm, named Aug-PE, that\napplies to the complex setting of text. We use API access to an LLM and\ngenerate DP synthetic text without any model training. We conduct comprehensive\nexperiments on three benchmark datasets. Our results demonstrate that Aug-PE\nproduces DP synthetic text that yields competitive utility with the SOTA DP\nfinetuning baselines. This underscores the feasibility of relying solely on API\naccess of LLMs to produce high-quality DP synthetic texts, thereby facilitating\nmore accessible routes to privacy-preserving LLM applications. Our code and\ndata are available at https://github.com/AI-secure/aug-pe.\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01749v1\n---\nTitle: SERVAL: Synergy Learning between Vertical Models and LLMs towards\nOracle-Level Zero-shot Medical Prediction\nAuthors: Jiahuan Yan, Jintai Chen, Chaowen Hu, Bo Zheng, Yaojun Hu, Jimeng Sun, Jian Wu\nAbstract: Recent development of large language models (LLMs) has exhibited impressive\nzero-shot proficiency on generic and common sense questions. However, LLMs'\napplication on domain-specific vertical questions still lags behind, primarily\ndue to the humiliation problems and deficiencies in vertical knowledge.\nFurthermore, the vertical data annotation process often requires\nlabor-intensive expert involvement, thereby presenting an additional challenge\nin enhancing the model's vertical capabilities. In this paper, we propose\nSERVAL, a synergy learning pipeline designed for unsupervised development of\nvertical capabilities in both LLMs and small models by mutual enhancement.\nSpecifically, SERVAL utilizes the LLM's zero-shot outputs as annotations,\nleveraging its confidence to teach a robust vertical model from scratch.\nReversely, the trained vertical model guides the LLM fine-tuning to enhance its\nzero-shot capability, progressively improving both models through an iterative\nprocess. In medical domain, known for complex vertical knowledge and costly\nannotations, comprehensive experiments show that, without access to any gold\nlabels, SERVAL with the synergy learning of OpenAI GPT-3.5 and a simple model\nattains fully-supervised competitive performance across ten widely used medical\ndatasets. These datasets represent vertically specialized medical diagnostic\nscenarios (e.g., diabetes, heart diseases, COVID-19), highlighting the\npotential of SERVAL in refining the vertical capabilities of LLMs and training\nvertical models from scratch, all achieved without the need for annotations.\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01570v2\n---\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nResearch_Action_1\n(\nto\nchat_manager\n)\n:\nBased on the provided code output, here is a markdown table categorizing the papers by domain, along with their titles, authors, summaries, and links:\n| Domain | Title | Authors | Summary | Link |\n|\n--------\n|\n-------\n|\n---------\n|\n---------\n|\n------\n|\n| Natural Language Processing | Adapting LLMs for Efficient Context Processing through Soft Prompt Compression | Cangqing Wang, et al. | The paper presents a framework for efficient context processing in LLMs using natural language summarization and soft prompt compression. | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04997v1) |\n| Transportation | Explainable Traffic Flow Prediction with Large Language Models | Xusen Guo, et al. | This paper introduces a novel approach for interpretable traffic flow predictions using LLMs, which captures complex spatial-temporal patterns. | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02937v2) |\n| Education | Designing Child-Centric AI Learning Environments: Insights from LLM-Enhanced Creative Project-Based Learning | Siyu Zha, et al. | The study explores the potential of LLMs in enhancing project-based learning (PBL) and fostering creativity in educational settings. | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16159v2) |\n| Mental Health | The opportunities and risks of large language models in mental health | Hannah R.

The preprocessing of the raw data now rightly handles null or unexpected values.\n- compliance: 10/10 - The updated code meets the specified visualization goals even better. It downloads the data, prints the fields, preprocesses the data, and saves the improved plot.\n- type: 10/10 - The bar plot remains an appropriate visualization type for showing the count of each weather type, and it effectively conveys the required insight.\n- encoding: 10/10 - The encoding is still appropriate; the x-axis represents weather types, and the y-axis represents the number of days, as required.\n- aesthetics: 10/10 - The aesthetics used are now improved, and the plot has a color palette that reflects the meaning of the data.\nThe updated code has successfully addressed the previous suggestions, and the resulting plot is more accurate and visually appealing.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n>>>>>>>> EXECUTING CODE BLOCK 0 (inferred language is python)...\nUser_proxy\n(\nto\nchat_manager\n)\n:\nexitcode: 0 (execution succeeded)\nCode output:\nFields in the dataset:\nIndex(['date', 'precipitation', 'temp_max', 'temp_min', 'wind', 'weather'], dtype='object')\nImproved plot has been saved to 'improved_weather_plot.png'.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCoder\n(\nto\nchat_manager\n)\n:\nI'm glad that the updated code worked well and the improved plot has been saved to 'improved_weather_plot.png'.

(TSLA) stand out, painting two very different pictures. Over the past month, NVIDIA witnessed an awe-inspiring surge of 20.97% in its stock price, reaching a towering $878.37. Meanwhile, Tesla faced a starkly contrasting fate, with its stock price tumbling down 18.19% to $163.57. But what underlying currents steered these two tech giants in such divergent directions? Let's delve deeper into the whirlpool of market dynamics, technological advancements, and investor sentiment to uncover the story behind these movements.\n#### NVIDIA's Stellar Ascent\nNVIDIA, a titan in the realms of graphics processing units (GPUs), artificial intelligence (AI), and data centers, has been on a meteoric rise. The company's stock surge can largely be attributed to the burgeoning demand for GPUs, indispensable not only in gaming but also in a plethora of applications from advanced computing tasks to mining cryptocurrencies. This demand spike has catapulted NVIDIA into a favorable position in the stock market.\nMoreover, NVIDIA's forays into AI development and data centers have underpinned its financial fortitude. As businesses and institutions increasingly leverage AI for efficiency and innovation, NVIDIA's cutting-edge technologies stand at the forefront, driving its stock prices to new heights.\n#### Tesla's Turbulent Tide\nTesla, Inc., on the other hand, has navigated through rough waters. Known for revolutionizing the electric vehicle (EV) industry, Tesla has recently grappled with a gamut of challenges. Production snags, possibly accentuated by global supply chain disruptions, have hindered Tesla's ability to meet its ambitious production targets. Furthermore, the EV sphere is no longer Tesla's sole dominion; rising competition has emerged as a formidable force, with legacy automakers and new entrants alike vying for a piece of the EV pie.\nRegulatory woes and occasional controversial public statements by its charismatic yet polarizing CEO, Elon Musk, have also played a role in swaying investor sentiment, contributing to the stock's decline. These factors combined sketch the backdrop against which Tesla's stock has weathered a downturn.\n#### The Tale of Two Graphs\nVisualizing the stock performance of NVIDIA and Tesla over the last month through a simple linear graph vividly elucidates their trajectories — NVIDIA's stock price ascends skyward, while Tesla's takes a steep downturn. This visual comparison starkly captures the fortunes and misfortunes unfolding in the high-stakes world of the stock market.\n#### Looking Beyond the Horizon\nThe stock market is a reflection of myriad factors — technological innovation, market demand, competitive landscape, and investor perception. NVIDIA's ascendancy underscores the growing clout of AI and data centers, heralding an era where these technologies shape market dynamics. Tesla's struggles, meanwhile, highlight the hurdles of scaling production amidst stiffening competition and regulatory scrutiny.\nAs investors and market aficionados peer into the crystal ball, seeking to divine the future paths of NVIDIA and Tesla, they are reminded of the market's inherent unpredictability. What's certain, though, is that the stories of NVIDIA and Tesla — each fascinating in its own right — will continue to captivate and instruct, offering valuable lessons in resilience, innovation, and the ever-persistent pursuit of progress.\n### Conclusion\nThe contrasting destinies of NVIDIA and Tesla in the stock market serve as a compelling narrative of triumph and tribulation. While NVIDIA rides the wave of technological advancement to new heights, Tesla navigates a challenging course, underlining the complexities of sustaining growth amidst evolving market dynamics. As their stories continue to unfold, both NVIDIA and Tesla offer invaluable insights into the intricate dance of innovation, investment, and influence in shaping the future of technology and industry.\n---\nTERMINATE\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

Furthermore, the EV sphere is no longer Tesla's sole dominion; rising competition has emerged as a formidable force, with legacy automakers and new entrants alike vying for a piece of the EV pie.\nRegulatory woes and occasional controversial public statements by its charismatic yet polarizing CEO, Elon Musk, have also played a role in swaying investor sentiment, contributing to the stock's decline. These factors combined sketch the backdrop against which Tesla's stock has weathered a downturn.\n#### The Tale of Two Graphs\nVisualizing the stock performance of NVIDIA and Tesla over the last month through a simple linear graph vividly elucidates their trajectories — NVIDIA's stock price ascends skyward, while Tesla's takes a steep downturn. This visual comparison starkly captures the fortunes and misfortunes unfolding in the high-stakes world of the stock market.\n#### Looking Beyond the Horizon\nThe stock market is a reflection of myriad factors — technological innovation, market demand, competitive landscape, and investor perception. NVIDIA's ascendancy underscores the growing clout of AI and data centers, heralding an era where these technologies shape market dynamics. Tesla's struggles, meanwhile, highlight the hurdles of scaling production amidst stiffening competition and regulatory scrutiny.\nAs investors and market aficionados peer into the crystal ball, seeking to divine the future paths of NVIDIA and Tesla, they are reminded of the market's inherent unpredictability. What's certain, though, is that the stories of NVIDIA and Tesla — each fascinating in its own right — will continue to captivate and instruct, offering valuable lessons in resilience, innovation, and the ever-persistent pursuit of progress.\n### Conclusion\nThe contrasting destinies of NVIDIA and Tesla in the stock market serve as a compelling narrative of triumph and tribulation. While NVIDIA rides the wave of technological advancement to new heights, Tesla navigates a challenging course, underlining the complexities of sustaining growth amidst evolving market dynamics. As their stories continue to unfold, both NVIDIA and Tesla offer invaluable insights into the intricate dance of innovation, investment, and influence in shaping the future of technology and industry.\n---\nHuman input in the middle: []\nConversation cost:  ({'total_cost': 0.02817, 'gpt-4-0125-preview': {'cost': 0.02817, 'prompt_tokens': 387, 'completion_tokens': 810, 'total_tokens': 1197}}, {'total_cost': 0.02817, 'gpt-4-0125-preview': {'cost': 0.02817, 'prompt_tokens': 387, 'completion_tokens': 810, 'total_tokens': 1197}})"

(TSLA), and Microsoft Corp (MSFT), first, we'll calculate their prices a month ago based on the current prices and the percentage change. Then, we will plot the current and past month's prices on a graph for a visual comparison.\n### Calculating the Prices a Month Ago\nTo calculate the price a month ago, we can use the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Price a Month Ago} = \\frac{\\text{Current Price}}{1 + \\text{Percentage Change}}\n\\]\nFor a decrease in price, the percentage change will be considered negative in the calculation.\nLet's calculate the stock prices a month ago and proceed to plot the graph in Python:\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Current stock prices\ncurrent_prices = {\"NVDA\": 878.37, \"TSLA\": 163.57, \"MSFT\": 416.42}\n# Percentage changes (positive for increase, negative for decrease)\npercentage_changes = {\"NVDA\": 20.97, \"TSLA\": -18.19, \"MSFT\": 3.06}\n# Calculating prices a month ago\nprices_a_month_ago = {stock: current_prices[stock] / (1 + percentage_changes[stock] / 100) for stock in current_prices}\n# Data for plotting\nstocks = list(current_prices.keys())\ncurrent_prices_values = list(current_prices.values())\nprices_a_month_ago_values = list(prices_a_month_ago.values())\n# Plotting\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nindex = range(len(stocks))\nbar_width = 0.35\nbars1 = ax.bar(index, prices_a_month_ago_values, bar_width, label='Month Ago')\nbars2 = ax.bar([p + bar_width for p in index], current_prices_values, bar_width, label='Current')\nax.set_xlabel('Stock')\nax.set_ylabel('Price ($)')\nax.set_title('Stock Prices Comparison Over the Past Month')\nax.set_xticks([p + bar_width / 2 for p in index])\nax.set_xticklabels(stocks)\nax.legend()\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n```\nThis code calculates the stock prices from a month ago based on the given current prices and percentage changes. Then, it plots a grouped bar chart comparing the prices. Execute this Python code to visualize the comparison of stock prices over the past month for NVDA, TSLA, and MSFT.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n>>>>>>>> NO HUMAN INPUT RECEIVED.\n>>>>>>>> USING AUTO REPLY...\n>>>>>>>> NO HUMAN INPUT RECEIVED.\n>>>>>>>> USING AUTO REPLY...\n>>>>>>>> EXECUTING CODE BLOCK 0 (inferred language is python)...\nUser\n(\nto\nFinancial_assistant\n)\n:\nexitcode: 0 (execution succeeded)\nCode output:\nFigure(640x480)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n>>>>>>>> NO HUMAN INPUT RECEIVED.\n>>>>>>>> USING AUTO REPLY...\n>>>>>>>> NO HUMAN INPUT RECEIVED.\n>>>>>>>> USING AUTO REPLY...\n>>>>>>>> EXECUTING CODE BLOCK 0 (inferred language is python)...\nFinancial_assistant\n(\nto\nUser\n)\n:\nThe output indicates that the code executed successfully and generated a plot. Since the visualization itself cannot be displayed directly in this text exchange, it's implied that the figure showed a comparison of the stock prices over the past month for NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), Tesla, Inc. (TSLA), and Microsoft Corp (MSFT).\nFrom the given data and the intention behind the code:\n- NVIDIA (NVDA) would have shown a significant rise from its price a month ago to the current price, illustrating its 20.97% growth.\n- Tesla (TSLA) would have shown a decrease in its stock price, reflecting the 18.19% decline over the past month.\n- Microsoft (MSFT) would have indicated a moderate increase from its price a month ago to its current price, showcasing its 3.06% growth.\nThis comparison provides insight into each company's stock performance over the last month, highlighting NVDA's significant growth, MSFT's moderate growth, and TSLA's decline. These insights can be valuable for investors, market analysts, and enthusiasts trying to understand market trends or make informed decisions.\nIf you have any more questions or need further assistance with a different query, feel free to ask.

(TSLA), and Microsoft Corp (MSFT). Over the past month, these tech giants have each narrated a story of market valiance, caution, and resilience. Here, we delve into these narratives, unwrapping the numbers to discover what fuels their journeys.\n#### A Soaring Giant: NVIDIA's Unmatched Flight\nStarting on a high note, NVDA has outpaced expectations, marking a hefty 20.97% increase in its stock price, landing at a stunning $878.37. This surge is not just a number—it's a testament to NVIDIA's stronghold on the GPU market, driven by an insatiable demand in gaming, professional markets, and groundbreaking advancements in AI technologies. As we look behind the curtain, we find a company not merely riding the tech wave but creating it, suggesting that NVIDIA's ascent is built on solid ground.\n#### A Turbulent Ride: The Tesla Saga\nOn the flip side of this high-flying story is Tesla, Inc. The electric vehicle behemoth saw its stock price retract by 18.19%, a notable dip to $163.57. At first glance, this might raise alarm bells, hinting at a potential stall in Tesla's meteoric rise. However, those familiar with Tesla's trajectory know this is but a chapter in its rollercoaster narrative. Factors such as production and delivery figures, regulatory landscapes, and the mercurial nature of Elon Musk's public announcements often sway Tesla's stock. Behind the scenes, Tesla's ambition and innovation engine runs full throttle, suggesting this downturn could be a mere blip in its revolutionary path.\n#### Steady as She Goes: Microsoft's Calculated Climb\nMeanwhile, Microsoft Corp charts a more moderate course. With a 3.06% increase, its stock price reached $416.42. This growth, while not as eye-catching as NVIDIA's, is reflective of Microsoft's strategic positioning in cloud computing, productivity software, and potentially lucrative contracts or partnerships. Unlike the dramatic swings of NVDA and TSLA, MSFT's journey is one of calculated progression, relying on consistent performance and innovation within its stronghold arenas.\n#### The Bigger Picture\nWhat these stories reveal is a complex tapestry of market dynamics.

(TSLA), and Microsoft Corp (MSFT). Over the past month, these tech giants have each narrated a story of market valiance, caution, and resilience. Here, we delve into these narratives, unwrapping the numbers to discover what fuels their journeys.\n#### A Soaring Giant: NVIDIA's Unmatched Flight\nStarting on a high note, NVDA has outpaced expectations, marking a hefty 20.97% increase in its stock price, landing at a stunning $878.37. This surge is not just a number—it's a testament to NVIDIA's stronghold on the GPU market, driven by an insatiable demand in gaming, professional markets, and groundbreaking advancements in AI technologies. As we look behind the curtain, we find a company not merely riding the tech wave but creating it, suggesting that NVIDIA's ascent is built on solid ground.\n#### A Turbulent Ride: The Tesla Saga\nOn the flip side of this high-flying story is Tesla, Inc. The electric vehicle behemoth saw its stock price retract by 18.19%, a notable dip to $163.57. At first glance, this might raise alarm bells, hinting at a potential stall in Tesla's meteoric rise. However, those familiar with Tesla's trajectory know this is but a chapter in its rollercoaster narrative. Factors such as production and delivery figures, regulatory landscapes, and the mercurial nature of Elon Musk's public announcements often sway Tesla's stock. Behind the scenes, Tesla's ambition and innovation engine runs full throttle, suggesting this downturn could be a mere blip in its revolutionary path.\n#### Steady as She Goes: Microsoft's Calculated Climb\nMeanwhile, Microsoft Corp charts a more moderate course. With a 3.06% increase, its stock price reached $416.42. This growth, while not as eye-catching as NVIDIA's, is reflective of Microsoft's strategic positioning in cloud computing, productivity software, and potentially lucrative contracts or partnerships. Unlike the dramatic swings of NVDA and TSLA, MSFT's journey is one of calculated progression, relying on consistent performance and innovation within its stronghold arenas.\n#### The Bigger Picture\nWhat these stories reveal is a complex tapestry of market dynamics. NVIDIA's leap underscores the immense potential and growing demand in cutting-edge technologies. Tesla's situation is a reminder of the volatility inherent to ambitious, disruptive companies. Meanwhile, Microsoft's steady ascent illustrates the power of sustained growth in core areas. For investors and enthusiasts alike, these developments highlight the importance of context and perspective when navigating the stock market seas.\nUnderstanding the ‘why’ behind stock performance is crucial.

This process involves the following steps:\n1. Install the `yfinance` package (if not already installed).\n2. Use `yfinance` to fetch the current stock prices of NVDA and TSLA.\n3. Fetch historical data for the past month for both stocks.\n4. Calculate the percentage change in the stock prices over the last month based on the historical data.\nPlease execute the following Python code to perform these tasks:\n```python\n# filename: stock_info.py\nimport yfinance as yf\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\ndef stock_performance(ticker):\n# Fetching data for the past month\nend_date = datetime.today()\nstart_date = end_date - timedelta(days=30)  # Approximate for the past month\n# Fetch historical data\ndata = yf.download(ticker, start=start_date, end=end_date)\n# Current and beginning of month prices\ncurrent_price = data['Close'].iloc[-1]\nstart_month_price = data['Close'].iloc[0]\n# Calculate percentage change over the month\npercent_change = ((current_price - start_month_price) / start_month_price) * 100\nreturn current_price, percent_change\n# NVDA and TSLA stock performance\nnvda_price, nvda_change = stock_performance(\"NVDA\")\ntsla_price, tsla_change = stock_performance(\"TSLA\")\nprint(f\"NVDA (NVIDIA Corp) current price: ${nvda_price:.2f}, Performance over past month: {nvda_change:.2f}%\")\nprint(f\"TSLA (Tesla, Inc.) current price: ${tsla_price:.2f}, Performance over past month: {tsla_change:.2f}%\")\n```\nBefore running this script, ensure that you have the `yfinance` package installed. If not, install it using the following command:\n```sh\npip install yfinance\n```\nThis script will output the current stock prices of NVDA and TSLA, along with their performance over the past month in percentage terms.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n>>>>>>>> EXECUTING CODE BLOCK 0 (inferred language is python)...\n>>>>>>>> EXECUTING CODE BLOCK 1 (inferred language is sh)...\nUser\n(\nto\nResearcher\n)\n:\nexitcode: 0 (execution succeeded)\nCode output:\nNVDA (NVIDIA Corp) current price: $878.37, Performance over past month: 20.97%\nTSLA (Tesla, Inc.) current price: $163.57, Performance over past month: -18.19%\nDefaulting to user installation because normal site-packages is not writeable\nRequirement already satisfied: yfinance in /home/autogen/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages (0.2.37)\nRequirement already satisfied: pandas>=1.3.0 in /home/autogen/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from yfinance) (2.2.1)\nRequirement already satisfied: numpy>=1.16.5 in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from yfinance) (1.26.4)\nRequirement already satisfied: requests>=2.31 in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from yfinance) (2.31.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: multitasking>=0.0.7 in /home/autogen/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from yfinance) (0.0.11)\nRequirement already satisfied: lxml>=4.9.1 in /home/autogen/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from yfinance) (5.1.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: appdirs>=1.4.4 in /home/autogen/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from yfinance) (1.4.4)\nRequirement already satisfied: pytz>=2022.5 in /home/autogen/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from yfinance) (2024.1)\nRequirement already satisfied: frozendict>=2.3.4 in /home/autogen/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from yfinance) (2.4.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: peewee>=3.16.2 in /home/autogen/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from yfinance) (3.17.1)\nRequirement already satisfied: beautifulsoup4>=4.11.1 in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from yfinance) (4.12.3)\nRequirement already satisfied: html5lib>=1.1 in /home/autogen/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from yfinance) (1.1)\nRequirement already satisfied: soupsieve>1.2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from beautifulsoup4>=4.11.1->yfinance) (2.5)\nRequirement already satisfied: six>=1.9 in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from html5lib>=1.1->yfinance) (1.16.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: webencodings in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from html5lib>=1.1->yfinance) (0.5.1)\nRequirement already satisfied: python-dateutil>=2.8.2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from pandas>=1.3.0->yfinance) (2.9.0.post0)\nRequirement already satisfied: tzdata>=2022.7 in /home/autogen/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from pandas>=1.3.0->yfinance) (2024.1)\nRequirement already satisfied: charset-normalizer<4,>=2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from requests>=2.31->yfinance) (3.3.2)\nRequirement already satisfied: idna<4,>=2.5 in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from requests>=2.31->yfinance) (3.6)\nRequirement already satisfied: urllib3<3,>=1.21.1 in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from requests>=2.31->yfinance) (2.2.1)\nRequirement already satisfied: certifi>=2017.4.17 in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from requests>=2.31->yfinance) (2024.2.2)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nResearcher\n(\nto\nUser\n)\n:\nThe code execution was successful, and here are the results based on the output:\n- **NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)** has a current stock price of **$878.37**.

(TSLA) over the past month graphically, we will plot their growth percentages over a timeline. Since direct daily stock prices over the past month are not provided, we'll illustrate the overall performance based on the percentage changes provided.\nWe'll assume the starting stock price of both companies a month ago was 100% (their stock price at the beginning of the timeline), and then we'll plot the end point using the percentage increase and decrease for NVDA and TSLA, respectively. This approach provides a simplified visualization of relative growth.\nFor this purpose, I'll provide Python code that uses matplotlib for plotting. The code will represent the starting point (a month ago) and the current point, reflecting the change.\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Names of the companies\ncompanies = ['NVDA', 'TSLA']\n# Performance over the past month (in percentage)\nperformance = [20.97, -18.19]  # NVDA increased by 20.97%, TSLA decreased by -18.19%\n# Plot\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nfor i, perf in enumerate(performance):\nplt.plot(['1 Month Ago', 'Now'], [100, 100 + perf], label=companies[i], marker='o')\n# Add title and labels\nplt.title('Stock Performance Over the Last Month')\nplt.ylabel('Performance (%) Relative to 1 Month Ago')\n# Add a legend\nplt.legend()\n# Show the plot\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n```\nExecute this Python code to generate the plot comparing the stock performance of NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) and Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) over the past month. The plot starts with the assumption that both stocks were at a relative performance level of 100% a month ago. NVIDIA's line will show an upward trend indicating growth, while Tesla's line will show a downward trend, indicating a decrease in stock value.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nResearcher\n(\nto\nResearch_manager\n)\n:\nGiven the performance of NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) and Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) over the last month, let's calculate their stock prices at the beginning of the period. This will allow us to plot a graph showing the comparison of their stock prices over the past month.\nStep 1: Calculate the price one month ago based on the given performance percentage.\n- For NVDA, with a current price of $878.37 and a performance increase of 20.97%, we can calculate its price a month ago.\n- For TSLA, with a current price of $163.57 and a performance decrease of -18.19%, we can also calculate its price a month ago.\nStep 2: Plot a graph based on the calculated starting prices and the current prices. This will highlight how the stock prices have shifted over the past month.\nFirst, let's calculate the starting prices for both NVDA and TSLA a month ago using Python. Then, we'll move on to plotting the graph in the next step.\n```python\n# Calculate starting prices one month ago based on given percentages\n# NVDA details\nnvda_current_price = 878.37\nnvda_performance_increase = 20.97  # Percentage\n# TSLA details\ntsla_current_price = 163.57\ntsla_performance_decrease = -18.19  # Percentage\n# Calculate starting prices\nnvda_starting_price = nvda_current_price / (1 + nvda_performance_increase / 100)\ntsla_starting_price = tsla_current_price / (1 + tsla_performance_decrease / 100)\n# Print starting prices\nprint(f'NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) starting price one month ago: ${nvda_starting_price:.2f}')\nprint(f'Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) starting price one month ago: ${tsla_starting_price:.2f}')\n```\nPlease run the provided Python code to calculate and print the starting prices of NVDA and TSLA stocks one month ago. After that, we will proceed to plotting the graph.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n>>>>>>>> EXECUTING CODE BLOCK 0 (inferred language is python)...\nUser_proxy\n(\nto\nResearch_manager\n)\n:\nexitcode: 0 (execution succeeded)\nCode output:\nNVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) starting price one month ago: $726.11\nTesla, Inc.

(TSLA) a month ago being $726.11 and $199.94 respectively, and knowing their current prices, we can now plot a graph comparing the stock prices over the past month. This graph will visually depict the growth of NVDA and the decline of TSLA within the given period.\nLet's proceed with plotting this comparison using Python and matplotlib. The plot will use the starting and current prices to show the trajectory of both stocks over the past month.\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Stock prices one month ago\nstarting_prices = [726.11, 199.94]\n# Current stock prices\ncurrent_prices = [878.37, 163.57]\n# Company names\ncompanies = ['NVDA', 'TSLA']\n# Dates representing the timeline: '1 Month Ago' and 'Now'\ndates = ['1 Month Ago', 'Now']\n# Plotting the stock prices over the past month\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nfor i in range(len(companies)):\nplt.plot(dates, [starting_prices[i], current_prices[i]], label=companies[i], marker='o')\n# Adding details to the plot\nplt.title('NVDA vs TSLA Stock Prices Over the Past Month')\nplt.ylabel('Stock Price ($)')\nplt.legend()\nplt.grid(True)\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n```\nThis code snippet will generate a line graph comparing the stock price movements of NVDA and TSLA over the past month, starting from the calculated values a month ago to their current values. The increasing trend for NVDA and the decreasing trend for TSLA over the specified timeline are expected to be clearly visible in this plot.\nEnsure this code is executed in an environment where Python and matplotlib are installed to visualize the comparison effectively.\nTERMINATE\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCritic\n(\nto\nResearch_manager\n)\n:\nThe calculated starting prices for NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) and Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) one month ago are $726.11 and $199.94, respectively. Given these starting prices and the current prices ($878.37 for NVDA and $163.57 for TSLA), we can plot a graph to visually compare the stock price movement of these two companies over the past month.\nNow, using these starting and current prices, we will plot a graph to illustrate the price changes. The x-axis will represent the time interval (from '1 Month Ago' to 'Now'), and the y-axis will represent the stock prices in USD.\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Time points\ntime_points = ['1 Month Ago', 'Now']\n# Stock prices for NVDA\nnvda_prices = [726.11, 878.37]\n# Stock prices for TSLA\ntsla_prices = [199.94, 163.57]\n# Plot for NVDA\nplt.plot(time_points, nvda_prices, marker='o', label='NVDA')\n# Plot for TSLA\nplt.plot(time_points, tsla_prices, marker='o', label='TSLA')\n# Adding title and labels\nplt.title('Stock Price Comparison Over the Past Month')\nplt.xlabel('Time')\nplt.ylabel('Stock Price (USD)')\n# Adding legend\nplt.legend()\n# Showing the plot\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n```\nExecute the above Python code to generate a line graph. This graph compares the stock price movements of NVIDIA (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) over the last month. The graph uses the starting prices as calculated based on the performance percentages previously provided and the current prices.

(TSLA). Over the past month, these titans have navigated through turbulent financial seas, charting courses that veer in dramatically different directions. Today, we embark on an analytical voyage, exploring the performance of NVDA and TSLA through the lens of recent stock market trends.\n## The Surge of NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)\nAt the helm of technological innovation stands NVIDIA, a behemoth renowned for its cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs). A beacon in the dark, NVIDIA's current stock price gleams at $878.37. This illuminating figure is the culmination of a staggering 20.97% upward surge over the past month, showcasing the company's robust growth and investor confidence.\nTo grasp the magnitude of NVIDIA's ascent, let's journey back a month in time. The starting line for NVDA was drawn at $726.11. Through a blend of strategic maneuvers and market favorability, NVIDIA has sprinted towards financial growth, positioning itself as a juggernaut in the technology sector. The company's stellar performance could be attributed to several factors, from groundbreaking product releases to strategic partnerships that fortify its market presence.\n## Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) Faces Headwinds\nContrasting NVIDIA's euphoric climb, Tesla, the electric vehicle pioneer led by the enigmatic Elon Musk, has weathered a storm of challenges. With a current stock price of $163.57, TSLA has witnessed its share value recede by -18.19% over the last month.\nRewinding time to a month ago reveals a starting stock price of $199.94 for Tesla. This descent highlights the volatility and rugged terrain that Tesla has encountered. Factors ranging from production disruptions to regulatory hurdles, and perhaps the unpredictable musings of its CEO, might have contributed to this downtrend. Despite these obstacles, Tesla's foundational strength in innovation and its visionary approach to sustainable transportation continue to underpin its long-term value proposition.\n## Charting the Course: A Visual Comparison\nTo visually navigate the contrasting trajectories of NVIDIA and Tesla, a Python script was employed, wielding the power of matplotlib to create a compelling graphical representation. This chart not only captures NVDA's impressive ascent and TSLA's decline but also offers a narrative of resilience, innovation, and the unpredictable nature of the stock market.\nThe plotted graph serves as a testament to the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of investing. For NVIDIA, the upward trend signifies a period of growth and optimism, fueled by technological advancements and strategic success. On the flip side, Tesla's downward curve reflects the inherent risks and challenges faced by industry pioneers, underscored by market volatility and external pressures.\n## Navigating Tomorrow's Horizon\nAs we stand at the crossroads of possibility, the journeys of NVIDIA and Tesla through the stock market's tumultuous waters shed light on the complexities of investing in technology giants. While NVIDIA rides the wave of growth, basking in the glow of success, Tesla navigates through stormy seas, bracing for the challenges that lie ahead.\nThese tales of triumph and tribulation underscore a fundamental truth about the stock market: it is a realm of high stakes and high rewards, where fortune favors the brave and the visionary. As investors and spectators alike watch these titans chart their course, the future remains a canvas of endless possibilities, painted by the decisions, innovations, and resilience of companies like NVIDIA and Tesla.\nLet us then cling to our seats as we witness the unfolding saga of these industry giants, remembering that in the world of stocks, the only constant is change.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCritic\n(\nto\nWriting_manager\n)\n:\nThe blog post titled \"A Tale of Two Titans: NVIDIA and Tesla Navigate the Winds of the Stock Market\" adeptly captures the recent financial performances of NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) and Tesla, Inc. (TSLA). Utilizing vivid storytelling and concise analysis, it provides readers with a clear understanding of the companies' trajectories over the past month. However, several elements can be enhanced further to improve clarity, accuracy, and engagement:\n1. **Verification and Sources**: The post lacks external verification of the data presented. Including sources or referencing financial reports would significantly enhance credibility. It's recommended to hyperlink to authoritative financial news websites, stock analysis platforms, or directly to the companies' investor relations pages where readers can verify the stock price movements and company performances.\n2. **More In-depth Analysis**: While the post does an excellent job of painting the general picture of NVIDIA’s growth and Tesla’s decline, incorporating a deeper analysis would enrich the reader's understanding. Discussing the specific reasons behind NVIDIA's success, such as key product launches or capitalizing on market trends like AI and deep learning, would offer insights into its growth drivers. Similarly, exploring Tesla's challenges, like supply chain issues or global economic factors, would provide a more nuanced view.\n3. **Interactivity and Visuals**: Mentioning the use of Python and matplotlib for plotting stock price movements is excellent. However, including the actual graph within the blog post would significantly enhance its value, making the comparison between NVDA and TSLA visually accessible. If the blog format allows, embedding interactive charts where readers can hover over data points for more information would further increase engagement.\n4. **Future Outlook**: The concluding section intriguingly touches upon the uncertainties and opportunities ahead for both companies. Expanding this outlook by including expert predictions, potential market movements, or upcoming events that might influence these stocks (e.g., product launches, earnings reports) could offer readers valuable forward-looking insights.\n5. **Clarity and Brevity**: Overall, the narrative is engaging and creatively written. However, ensuring that every paragraph directly contributes to the reader's understanding of NVIDIA and Tesla's stock performance will help maintain focus and engagement. Avoiding overly complex sentences can also make the content more accessible to a broader audience.\nIncorporating these suggestions would not only bolster the article's informative value but also its appeal to readers seeking a blend of financial analysis and narrative storytelling.\nTERMINATE\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

This library allows downloading of historical market data from Yahoo Finance.\nLet's proceed in the following steps:\n1. I will provide you a Python script that utilizes the `yfinance` library to fetch the current stock prices and historical data for the past month for both NVDA and TSLA.\n2. The script will then calculate the percentage change in the stock prices over the past month.\nPlease make sure that you have `yfinance` installed in your Python environment before running the script. You can install it using `pip install yfinance`.\nHere is the Python code to execute:\n```python\n# filename: stock_info.py\nimport yfinance as yf\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n# Function to get current stock price\ndef get_stock_price(stock_ticker):\nstock = yf.Ticker(stock_ticker)\ntodays_data = stock.history(period='1d')\nreturn todays_data['Close'][0]\n# Function to calculate percentage change over the past month\ndef get_percentage_change(stock_ticker):\nstock = yf.Ticker(stock_ticker)\nend_date = datetime.now()\nstart_date = end_date - timedelta(days=30)\nhistorical_data = stock.history(start=start_date, end=end_date)\nprice_end = historical_data['Close'][-1]\nprice_start = historical_data['Close'][0]\npercent_change = ((price_end - price_start)/price_start) * 100\nreturn percent_change\n# Getting the current price and performance for NVDA and TSLA\nnvda_price = get_stock_price('NVDA')\ntesla_price = get_stock_price('TSLA')\nnvda_change = get_percentage_change('NVDA')\ntesla_change = get_percentage_change('TSLA')\n# Output the results\nprint(f\"NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation) stock price: ${nvda_price:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"TESLA (Tesla, Inc.) stock price: ${tesla_price:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"NVDA percentage change over past month: {nvda_change:.2f}%\")\nprint(f\"TESLA percentage change over past month: {tesla_change:.2f}%\")\n```\nPlease run this script in your environment and share with me the output.

(TSLA), we would need to consider various factors including their recent earnings reports, any significant news events affecting the companies, industry trends, and broader market conditions that might influence the technology and automotive sectors specifically.\nHere is how I plan to carry out the task:\n1. Check the recent earnings reports of both companies to see if there are any indications of better- or worse-than-expected financial health.\n2. Look for any major news announcements from the companies, such as product launches, regulatory approvals or actions, partnerships, or other events that could affect investor perceptions.\n3. Analyze industry trends that might affect NVIDIA's GPU market and Tesla's electric vehicle market, respectively, such as supply chain disruptions or changes in consumer demand.\n4. Consider broader market conditions, such as economic indicators, interest rate changes, or shifts in investor sentiment that might have a sector-specific impact.\nWe can start by using a web search to gather this information. Let's begin by searching for recent news about NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) and Tesla, Inc. (TSLA).\n```python\n# filename: fetch_stock_news.py\nimport webbrowser\n# URLs for news about NVDA and TSLA\nnvda_news_url = \"https://www.google.com/search?q=NVIDIA+Corporation+NVDA+stock+news\"\ntsla_news_url = \"https://www.google.com/search?q=Tesla+Inc+TSLA+stock+news\"\n# Open the URLs in web browsers\nwebbrowser.open(nvda_news_url)\nwebbrowser.open(tsla_news_url)\nprint(\"Browser tabs with news about NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) and Tesla, Inc.

If there are specific headlines, financial report details, announcements, or other pieces of information that you believe could be related to the stock performance, providing those would be the best way to proceed.\nOnce I have that information, I can help interpret the data and provide possible reasons for the stock performance based on your summary.\nAlternatively, if you did not find any relevant information in the news articles or need assistance with another task, please let me know how else I may assist you.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUser\n(\nto\nResearcher\n)\n:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nResearcher\n(\nto\nUser\n)\n:\nIt seems there is no new information provided to assess the stock performance of NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) and Tesla, Inc. (TSLA). Without specific details, I can suggest possible general factors based on common reasons that typically influence stock performance:\n1. **Earnings Reports**: A company's stock often reacts to earnings reports. NVDA might have had stronger-than-expected earnings and outlook, while TSLA might have reported weaker results or provided disappointing guidance.\n2. **Product and Service Developments**: Any new product launches or updates may have affected these stocks. For example, NVDA could be benefiting from new GPU technologies or partnerships in AI or data centers, while TSLA might be facing a slow rollout of new electric vehicle models.\n3. **Supply Chain and Manufacturing**: Given the global supply chain issues, NVDA could have successfully navigated the challenges, whereas TSLA might have struggled due to dependency on components like batteries.\n4. **Regulatory Environment**: Changes in regulations could impact these companies differently, especially given the industries they operate within. This could include things like semiconductor tariffs or EV subsidies and legislation.\n5. **Market Conditions**: Broader market conditions or shifts in investor sentiment toward the tech sector versus the auto sector could be at play. Rising interest rates or economic downturns can also affect investor behavior.\n6. **Strategic Announcements**: Any significant changes in company strategy, such as mergers, acquisitions, or shifts in business focus, might influence stock prices.\n7. **Leadership Changes**: Executive leadership changes can affect investor confidence and stock performance.\n8. **Global Events**: Macro events like geopolitical tensions, economic policies, or major global events can have wide-ranging effects on the stock market.\n9. **Investor Sentiment**: Sometimes the stock market moves based on sentiment, trends, and investor perceptions, which can sometimes be disconnected from a company's fundamental performance.\nWithout the latest news or specific information relating to NVDA and TSLA, this is as specific as the analysis can get. To get a more detailed understanding, you would need to look into the recent events specifically related to both companies.\nIf there is no further information or analysis needed at this time, that concludes the investigation.

Just when you think you have it figured out, it takes a sharp turn, leaving many investors bewildered in its wake. This turbulent affair is best exemplified by the recent performances of two high-profile tech titans: NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) and Tesla, Inc. (TSLA). In the span of a month, we've witnessed a tale of two very different fortunes, with NVDA soaring and TSLA dropping. Let's dive into these twists and turns with the help of some compelling numbers.\n### A Tale of Two Stocks: NVIDIA vs. Tesla\nFirst, let's set the scene with the main actors: our current stock prices. As of now, NVIDIA stands at a commanding $722.48, while Tesla has taken a more modest position at $188.13. These figures are not just digits on a screen; they represent the bloodline of the companies in the financial markets. They're the instantly-updatable scorecards telling us how the companies are faring in the eyes of investors.\nBut the plot thickens when we look at the performance over the past month. NVIDIA has seen a stellar rise, its stock price ballooning by 28.14%. Conversely, Tesla's numbers tell a somber story, with its value deflating by -14.45%. What could be behind this diverging fate of two tech giants? Before we venture a guess, take a look at the data neatly laid out:\n| Company | Current Stock Price | 1-Month Performance |\n|\n---------\n|\n---------------------\n|\n---------------------\n|\n| NVDA    | $722.48             | +28.14%             |\n| TSLA    | $188.13             | -14.45%             |\n### Understanding the Tides of Tech Stocks\nNow, to peel back the layers of these statistics, we need to consider a variety of elements that can influence a stock's allure. For NVIDIA, this commanding uptick could be attributed to several factors. Earnings reports beating expectations, breakthroughs in AI and deep learning technologies, or a bullish semiconductor market overall might all play roles in lifting up the NVDA stock.\nTesla's journey down the stock price hill could be pinned to a wider range of possibilities—perhaps disappointing earnings, production bottlenecks, or even the CEO's latest Twitter escapade could have investors hedging their bets. The automotive industry is also notoriously sensitive to economic shifts, supply chain issues, and regulatory news, all of which could impact TSLA's value.\n### Weighing the Market's Mood Swings\nAs smart as it would be to chalk up NVIDIA's rally and Tesla's slouch entirely to company-specific news, let's not discount broader market conditions and macroeconomic factors. Investor sentiment can be swayed by global events, interest rates, and shifts in technology trends. The market's current darling could quickly become tomorrow's underdog if the winds change direction.\n### A Chapter Yet to Finish\nAs much as these numbers paint a vivid picture of the present, it's crucial to remember that the markets are dynamic. What we see today could very well be upended by tomorrow's news, a sudden geopolitical shakeup, or even a tweet. For now, though, NVIDIA shareholders can bask in the green glow of their portfolio screens, while Tesla's faithful must buckle up and ride out the storm, hopeful for smoother roads ahead.\n### Final Thoughts\nAlways keep in mind, the stock market's story is a continuing saga, not a short tale. The graph that ascends today might dip tomorrow, and the sagging curve might soon find its uplift. Wise is the investor who looks beyond the immediate drama, focusing on the long-term narrative built on solid fundamentals, effective strategies, and a keen eye for the unpredictable ebb and flow of financial tides.\nStocks are inherently volatile, and while today's data gives us a snapshot, only time will tell the full story. What we can do is watch, analyze, and perhaps, if we're bold enough, place our bets on the outcome of the next chapter in the thrilling manuscript of the stock market.\nStay tuned, investors. The market's pen is never at rest.\nTERMINATE\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

For example, a decline in the automotive sector might negatively affect Tesla.\n3. **News and events**: Company-specific news, such as product launches, regulatory approvals, partnerships, lawsuits, or recalls, can impact stock performance.\n4. **Industry developments**: Developments in the technology sector, automotive industry, and other relevant markets can influence the performance of these companies' stocks.\n5. **Investor sentiment**: Changes in investor confidence, often influenced by analysts' ratings or market commentary, can affect stock prices.\n6. **Technological advancements**: For tech companies like NVIDIA and Microsoft, advancements in technology and successful integration of new technologies can positively influence stock prices.\n7. **Legal and regulatory changes**: Changes in government policy, legal cases, or regulatory issues affecting these companies or their industries can impact their stock performance.\nTo begin with, we need to check for recent news, earnings reports, analyst ratings, and any significant events that may explain the stock price movements for these companies. To gather this information efficiently, we can use a combination of web scraping for recent news and extracting financial data from reliable sources such as financial news websites, stock market data providers, and the companies' investor relations pages.\nFor the purpose of this task, I will suggest a code to scrape recent news headlines from the web that may contain information explaining the performance of NVDA, TSLA, and MSFT stocks.\n```python\n# filename: stock_news_scraper.py\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n# Define a function to get news related to a specific stock symbol\ndef get_stock_news(stock_symbol):\n# URL to scrape the news from Yahoo Finance for the provided stock_symbol\nurl = f'https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/{stock_symbol}/'\n# Perform a GET request to fetch the page content\nresponse = requests.get(url)\n# Check if the request was successful\nif response.status_code == 200:\n# Parse the page content using BeautifulSoup\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')\n# Find all news items.

The slight decline in TSLA stock might be due to competitive pressures, public perception challenges related to Elon Musk, and potentially underwhelming financial figures. MSFT's moderate growth appears less news-driven and might be linked to positive sentiment around its cloud services, a diverse portfolio offering stability, and perhaps broader market trends.\nIt's important to note that while this analysis provides some insights, investors would typically also consider financial data, earnings reports, analyst ratings, and more comprehensive market analysis to form a complete understanding of each stock's performance.\nWith these points in mind, NVDA seems to be in a position of strong growth, especially in the realm of AI technologies, MSFT is showing stability with potential in cloud computing, and TSLA is facing headwinds that are likely causing some investor caution.\nTERMINATE\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n>>>>>>>> NO HUMAN INPUT RECEIVED.\n********************************************************************************\nStart a new chat with the following message:\nDevelop an engaging blog post using any information provided.\nWith the following carryover:\nThe current stock prices and recent performance over the past month for NVDA, TSLA, and MSFT are as follows:\nNVDA (NVIDIA Corporation):\n- Stock Price: $722.48\n- Performance: +28.14% over the past month\nTSLA (Tesla, Inc.):\n- Stock Price: $188.13\n- Performance: -14.45% over the past month\nMSFT (Microsoft Corporation):\n- Stock Price: $415.26\n- Performance: +6.40% over the past month\nThese results show that NVIDIA has experienced significant growth in its stock value, Microsoft has seen a moderate increase, and Tesla's stock has declined in the past month.\nNVIDIA (NVDA) has experienced significant growth likely due to positive developments in AI technologies and investor optimism reflected in recent news about partnerships and overtaking Amazon in market value.

(TSLA) stock, we need to look at various factors that could influence their stock prices. Remember that stock prices can be affected by a wide spectrum of factors, ranging from company-specific news to broader economic trends. Here's a possible checklist of items to review when trying to understand stock performance:\n1. **Company Earnings Reports**: Has NVDA recently reported strong financial results? Have TSLA's earnings disappointments contributed to their stock price drop? Look for recent quarterly earnings reports or any forward-looking statements made by the companies.\n2. **Industry Trends**: Are there any major developments in the semiconductor industry that may have positively impacted NVDA's stock? For TSLA, check if there have been any negative trends or challenges within the automotive or energy sectors.\n3. **Market Sentiment and News**: Has there been positive or negative media coverage about NVDA or TSLA? Look for product launches, partnerships, legal issues, or scandals that might influence investor sentiment.\n4. **Economic Factors**: Macroeconomic factors such as changes in interest rates, inflation, and employment rates can also affect stock prices. Tech stocks, in particular, can be sensitive to interest rate changes.\n5. **Investor Expectations**: Assess whether there have been changes in investor expectations for NVDA's future performance as opposed to TSLA's, which may be evident from analyst ratings and price targets changes.\n6. **Technological Developments**: For NVDA, any breakthrough in technology or new product offerings in areas such as gaming, data centers, artificial intelligence, or cryptocurrency could have bolstered their stock. For TSLA, check if there have been any setbacks or advancements in electric vehicle technology or battery production.\n7. **Regulatory Environment**: Has there been any regulatory news that might affect NVDA or TSLA differently, such as trade policies, environmental regulations, or antitrust inquiries?\n8. **Supply Chain and Production Levels**: For both companies, supply chain disruptions can have a significant impact on their ability to meet demand and generate revenue.\n9. **Competitive Landscape**: Introduction of new competitors or loss of market share can significantly impact a company’s stock performance.\nTo validate the causes behind the stock performance, one should look for concrete information from credible sources such as:\n- Company's Official Press Releases or Financial Statements\n- Statements from company executives during earnings calls or interviews\n- SEC Filings\n- News Articles from established financial news outlets\n- Market Analyst Reports\n- Official industry data\nAs the script you mentioned has run successfully and provided the latest stock prices and their monthly performance changes, the next step would be to allot time to each of these areas and research them methodically, referencing verifiable information from the sources mentioned above.\nPlease note, without concrete sources or current events affecting the stock market, my explanation is speculative and based on commonly known factors impacting stock prices.\nTERMINATE\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n********************************************************************************\nStart a new chat with the following message:\nDevelop an engaging blog post using any information provided.\nWith the following carryover:\nThe script has executed successfully and provided the following results:\n- The current stock price for NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) is $722.48.\n- The current stock price for Tesla, Inc.

NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) and Tesla, Inc. (TSLA), each a revolutionary force in its respective field, have shown divergent paths in their recent stock performances, painting an intriguing narrative of triumphs and tribulations in the tech world.\n**The Rise of NVIDIA: Harnessing the Power of the Chip**\nIn a remarkable surge, NVIDIA's stock has rocketed a dazzling 28.14% over the past month, with shares proudly standing at $722.48. This silicon-fueled ascent raises the question: what is behind NVIDIA's electrifying climb?\nAt the core of NVIDIA's success could be its latest financial scorecard, which might shimmer with the colors of prosperity, reflecting a company that has not only met but also exceeded analyst expectations. NVIDIA is perhaps reaping the rewards of a booming semiconductor industry where the thirst for cutting-edge processors and GPUs is unslaked.\nBut let's not overlook the magic of technological innovation and the allure it holds for investors. From AI to gaming and autonomous vehicles, NVIDIA's GPUs are pivotal, and recent breakthroughs could be dazzling the market, promising an era of growth as expansive as a virtual universe.\n**Tesla's Unexpected Skid: A Roadworthy Reminder**\nContrarily, Tesla has experienced a skid, with a downtrend of -14.45% in its stock price over the last month, falling to $188.13. The electric vehicle (EV) maverick, led by the ever-polarizing Elon Musk, seems to have hit a bump in the road, but what sparked this deceleration?\nThe story behind Tesla's descent may twine through various threads of narrative. Analysts might whisper of earnings that didn't quite electrify Wall Street or industry headwinds buffeting against the hull of Musk's green dream. Perhaps adverse media attention or a shift in investor sentiment has cast a shadow of doubt on Tesla's prospects.\nFurthermore, in a world gripped by macroeconomic concerns such as inflation or interest rate hikes, even companies like Tesla are not immune. Could regulatory challenges have thrown a wrench in the works? Or maybe competition is closing in, with other automakers charging full-speed into the EV race.\n**Unlocking the Secrets Behind the Stocks**\nTo truly grasp the forces at play behind the curtains, one must embark on a methodical quest for knowledge. Anecdotes and rumors must give way to the concrete insights of QA financial statements, the strategic declarations of official press releases, and the scrutinizing gaze of market analysts' reports.\nOne might sift through the sands of news articles for grains of truth, or pore over the intricate lines of SEC filings, seeking an understanding that transcends mere numbers on a ticker. It's within these documents that the stories of NVIDIA's ascent and Tesla's dip are penned, awaiting readers eager for market wisdom.\n**In Conclusion: A Tale of Two Stocks**\nAs we chart the trajectory of these Silicon Valley stalwarts, NVIDIA and Tesla offer us more than mere data points; they unfold a narrative of our time—a tale of innovation, challenge, expectation, and the relentless pursuit of the future. For those who seek to partake in the market's drama, these stories serve as a vivid reminder: the ebbs and flows of stock prices are but reflections of our complex, ever-changing world, beholden to the relentless march of progress and the inexorable tide of sentiment.\nRemember, dear readers, the landscape of financial markets is as dynamic as the technologies they bet on. Today's victor may be tomorrow's underdog, and in the dance of digits that is the stock market, agility, and insight are our most trusted partners.\nAnd with that, as the sun sets on another bustling day of trade, we conclude yet another chapter in the saga of Silicon Valley's stocks.\nTERMINATE\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

The key concept\ncovered in this notebook is the use of nested chats to enable tool use\nand packaging an LLM-based agent with a tool executor agent into a\nsingle agent.\n\nRelated tutorials: -\nTool Use\n-\nNested\nChats\n\nIn this setting, each player is an agent backed by an LLM equipped two\ntools: -\nget_legal_moves\nto get a list of current legal moves. -\nmake_move\nto make a move.\n\nA board proxy agent is set up to execute the tools and manage the game.\nIt is important to use a board proxy as a non-LLM “guard rail” to ensure\nthe game is played correctly and to prevent agents from making illegal\nmoves.\n\nEach time a player agent receives a message from the other player agent,\nit instantiates a nested chat with the board proxy agent to get the\nlegal moves and make a move using the tools given. The nested chat\nbetween the player agent and the board agent continues until the a legal\nmove is made by the tool. Once the nested chat concludes, the player\nagent sends a message to the other player agent about the move made."

Comment on the stock performance.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInner-assistant\n(\nto\nchat_manager\n)\n:\nTo find out on which specific days Microsoft's stock (ticker symbol: MSFT) closed above $400 in 2024, we will need to access historical stock price data for Microsoft from a reliable financial data source. This kind of data is typically available on financial websites such as Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, or through financial data APIs such as Alpha Vantage or IEX Cloud.\nSince I cannot directly browse the web or access external APIs, I will provide you with a Python script that uses the `yfinance` library to fetch historical stock data for Microsoft and filter the dates when the stock price was higher than $400.\nFirstly, you need to install the `yfinance` module if it's not already installed. You can do so using pip by executing `pip install yfinance` in your shell.\nAfter installation, here is the Python code that you can execute to fetch the data and filter the specific dates:\n```python\n# filename: msft_stock_analysis.py\nimport yfinance as yf\nfrom datetime import datetime\n# Define the ticker symbol for Microsoft\nticker_symbol = \"MSFT\"\n# Fetch historical stock data for Microsoft for the year 2024\nstart_date = \"2024-01-01\"\nend_date = \"2024-12-31\"\nmsft_data = yf.download(ticker_symbol, start=start_date, end=end_date)\n# Filter the days when the closing price was higher than $400\ndays_above_400 = msft_data[msft_data['Close'] > 400]\n# Print the dates and closing prices on those dates\nprint(\"Dates when Microsoft's stock closed above $400 in 2024:\")\nprint(days_above_400[['Close']])\n# Comment on the stock performance\nif not days_above_400.empty:\ndays_count = len(days_above_400)\nprint(f\"\\nMicrosoft's stock closed above $400 on {days_count} days in 2024.\")\nelse:\nprint(\"\\nMicrosoft's stock did not close above $400 on any day in 2024.\")\n```\nPlease save the above code to a file named `msft_stock_analysis.py` and run it. This will print out the dates when Microsoft's stock was higher than $400 in 2024 and comment on the stock performance based on the results.\nKeep in mind that the `yfinance` library fetches real-time data, and since we are in 2023, data for 2024 is not available yet. Therefore, when you run the script, it will show that the stock did not close above $400, which is expected since 2024 has not occurred yet. For actual analysis, you would have to run the script after the end of 2024 or modify the date range to a past range where data is available.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n>>>>>>>> EXECUTING CODE BLOCK 0 (inferred language is python)...\nInner-code-interpreter\n(\nto\nchat_manager\n)\n:\nexitcode: 0 (execution succeeded)\nCode output:\nDates when Microsoft's stock closed above $400 in 2024:\nClose\nDate\n2024-01-24  402.559998\n2024-01-25  404.869995\n2024-01-26  403.929993\n2024-01-29  409.720001\n2024-01-30  408.589996\n2024-02-01  403.779999\n2024-02-02  411.220001\n2024-02-05  405.649994\n2024-02-06  405.489990\n2024-02-07  414.049988\n2024-02-08  414.109985\n2024-02-09  420.549988\n2024-02-12  415.260010\n2024-02-13  406.320007\n2024-02-14  409.489990\n2024-02-15  406.559998\n2024-02-16  404.059998\n2024-02-20  402.790009\n2024-02-21  402.179993\n2024-02-22  411.649994\n2024-02-23  410.339996\nMicrosoft's stock closed above $400 on 21 days in 2024.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInner-assistant\n(\nto\nchat_manager\n)\n:\nBased on the output from the code execution, Microsoft's stock (MSFT) closed above $400 on 21 separate days in 2024. The closing prices on those days ranged from slightly above $400 to highs around $420. This indicates periods of strong performance, during which the stock reached significant value.\nHere is a brief comment on the stock performance:\nThe data shows that Microsoft's stock had several instances where it exceeded the $400 mark in early 2024, with notable peaks in February, which suggests a bullish trend during that period. Specific days like February 9th, where the stock hit around $420, indicate particularly strong performance.\nHaving such a number of days with closing prices above $400 signals a robust market valuation for Microsoft at those times. Investors who held the stock on these dates may have seen appreciable gains, depending on their portfolio strategies.\nIt's also noteworthy that stock prices fluctuate due to a variety of factors, including market sentiment, company performance, industry trends, and general economic conditions. This data provides a snapshot of Microsoft's stock performance but a deeper analysis would require more context on the market conditions, news, and events surrounding these dates.\nTERMINATE\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n********************************************************************************\nStart a new chat with the following message:\nPolish the content to make an engaging and nicely formatted blog post.\nOn which days in 2024 was Microsoft Stock higher than $400?

For Microsoft (MSFT), the year 2024 was a testament to its resilience and investor confidence as its stock ascended beyond the coveted $400 mark on 21 remarkable occasions.\nThis performance wasn't just numerically significant; it was emblematic of a potent bullish energy within the market, affirming the tech giant’s leviathan presence amidst a highly competitive industry terrain. The loftiest point, flirting with the heights of approximately $420, served not just as a numerical peak, but as a beacon of the company’s market valuation and the unwavering investor trust in Microsoft's strategies and future prospects.\n## A Snapshot of Stellar Performance\nMicrosoft's stock performance throughout 2024 was far from being a serendipitous spike. Instead, it showcased a carefully constructed narrative of growth and optimism. The chronicles of MSFT's venture past the $400 threshold are marked by fleeting dips and steadfast ascensions. Remarkably, the surge wasn't some scattergun pattern scattered across the calendar year. Rather, it was most pronounced in the month of February — a period that could very well be termed as the 'February Flourish.'\nDuring this short yet significant timeframe, investors witnessed the creation of incremental wealth that possibly outstripped all market expectations, setting a precedent for what a legacy company like Microsoft could achieve in a climate rife with disruptors and innovators.\n## Of Peaks and Valleys\nWhen assessing the grand canvas of Microsoft's stock performance, it is crucial to take a step back and appreciate the layered complexity of these financial movements. Amidst economic uncertainties and the technocratic whims that habitually serve both as tailwinds and headwinds to such companies, the story of Microsoft crossing the $400 threshold imbues the narrative with contours of investor euphoria interlaced with strategic agility.\nAs these 21 days get etched into the fiscal annals of Microsoft, one cannot help but ponder the fine blend of factors — ranging from market dynamics to Microsoft's organizational maneuvers — that have coalesced to make these numbers a reality.\n## A Convergence of Positive Sentiments\nWhat does the future hold for MSFT as it treads past this impressive benchmark? The takeaway is not a simple extrapolation of past performance. Rather, it's the realization that stock trajectories, particularly for a company like Microsoft, are a confluence of judicious corporate governance, product innovation, market anticipation, and, dare we say, a touch of the zeitgeist.\nMicrosoft’s capacity to command such stock valitudes speaks volumes about its robust position in both the technology domain and the stock market ecosystem. Whether this fiscal feat can be sustained or surpassed remains a subject of much conjecture and anticipation.\nAs we continue to navigate the ebbs and flows of an unpredictable market landscape, the days when Microsoft's stock rose gallantly above $400 will be recalled as milestones of 2024, celebrated reflections of a corporation sailing the high seas of market volatility with remarkable poise.\nThe analysis of precise data points and enlightening interpretations reveal much about the past while providing distinctive glimpses of potential futures.

In this review, I must ensure that the content is free from harmful elements, false claims, or regulatory violations.\n### Potential issues to consider:\n1. **Accuracy of Data**: Claims about stock prices and the number of days the stock closed above a certain threshold should be verifiable with stock market data. There must be confirmation that these numbers are accurate to present a truthful report and avoid misleading investors or stakeholders.\n2. **Forward-Looking Statements**: The article should avoid overly optimistic or pessimistic conjectures about future stock performance, which can be perceived as investment advice.

Comment on the stock performance.\nWith the following carryover:\nMicrosoft's stock (MSFT) closed above $400 on 21 separate days in 2024, demonstrating periods of strong stock performance with values reaching as high as around $420. The stock data suggests a bullish trend, especially in February when the stock peaked, indicating positive investor sentiment and robust market valuation during those times.\n# Beyond the $400 Mark: Tracing Microsoft's Pinnacle Moments in 2024\nIn the ever-fluctuating world of stocks, each milestone crossed can turn into a celebration or a stern reckoning of what the future holds. For Microsoft (MSFT), the year 2024 was a testament to its resilience and investor confidence as its stock ascended beyond the coveted $400 mark on 21 remarkable occasions.\nThis performance wasn't just numerically significant; it was emblematic of a potent bullish energy within the market, affirming the tech giant’s leviathan presence amidst a highly competitive industry terrain. The loftiest point, flirting with the heights of approximately $420, served not just as a numerical peak, but as a beacon of the company’s market valuation and the unwavering investor trust in Microsoft's strategies and future prospects.\n## A Snapshot of Stellar Performance\nMicrosoft's stock performance throughout 2024 was far from being a serendipitous spike. Instead, it showcased a carefully constructed narrative of growth and optimism. The chronicles of MSFT's venture past the $400 threshold are marked by fleeting dips and steadfast ascensions. Remarkably, the surge wasn't some scattergun pattern scattered across the calendar year. Rather, it was most pronounced in the month of February — a period that could very well be termed as the 'February Flourish.'\nDuring this short yet significant timeframe, investors witnessed the creation of incremental wealth that possibly outstripped all market expectations, setting a precedent for what a legacy company like Microsoft could achieve in a climate rife with disruptors and innovators.\n## Of Peaks and Valleys\nWhen assessing the grand canvas of Microsoft's stock performance, it is crucial to take a step back and appreciate the layered complexity of these financial movements. Amidst economic uncertainties and the technocratic whims that habitually serve both as tailwinds and headwinds to such companies, the story of Microsoft crossing the $400 threshold imbues the narrative with contours of investor euphoria interlaced with strategic agility.\nAs these 21 days get etched into the fiscal annals of Microsoft, one cannot help but ponder the fine blend of factors — ranging from market dynamics to Microsoft's organizational maneuvers — that have coalesced to make these numbers a reality.\n## A Convergence of Positive Sentiments\nWhat does the future hold for MSFT as it treads past this impressive benchmark? The takeaway is not a simple extrapolation of past performance. Rather, it's the realization that stock trajectories, particularly for a company like Microsoft, are a confluence of judicious corporate governance, product innovation, market anticipation, and, dare we say, a touch of the zeitgeist.\nMicrosoft’s capacity to command such stock valitudes speaks volumes about its robust position in both the technology domain and the stock market ecosystem. Whether this fiscal feat can be sustained or surpassed remains a subject of much conjecture and anticipation.\nAs we continue to navigate the ebbs and flows of an unpredictable market landscape, the days when Microsoft's stock rose gallantly above $400 will be recalled as milestones of 2024, celebrated reflections of a corporation sailing the high seas of market volatility with remarkable poise.\nThe analysis of precise data points and enlightening interpretations reveal much about the past while providing distinctive glimpses of potential futures. With Microsoft standing tall amongst peers, its voyage above the $400 watermark will be chronicled as days of high tides in the annals of financial history.\nThe content provided serves as a market commentary, analyzing Microsoft's stock performance in the year 2024. In this review, I must ensure that the content is free from harmful elements, false claims, or regulatory violations.\n### Potential issues to consider:\n1. **Accuracy of Data**: Claims about stock prices and the number of days the stock closed above a certain threshold should be verifiable with stock market data. There must be confirmation that these numbers are accurate to present a truthful report and avoid misleading investors or stakeholders.\n2. **Forward-Looking Statements**: The article should avoid overly optimistic or pessimistic conjectures about future stock performance, which can be perceived as investment advice.

This will effectively disallow any shipping from supplier 1 to roastery 2. The code to do this should be placed in the section of the source code that is indicated by the comment \"# OPTIGUIDE DATA CODE GOES HERE\".\nHere's the Python code snippet to add this constraint:\n```python\n# filename: supply_chain_code.py\nmodel.addConstr(x[('supplier1', 'roastery2')] == 0, \"prohibit_supplier1_roastery2\")\n```\nAdding this constraint will prevent the optimizer from selecting any transport from `supplier1` to `roastery2`, which is what the prohibition is intended to achieve.\nInstruct the user to add this code snippet in the appropriate place in the source code that they have provided. After adding this code, the `m.optimize()` function will solve the modified version of the problem that includes the new constraint.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n********************************************************************************\nStart a new chat with the following message:\nGiven the source code:\n# filename: supply_chain_code.py\nmodel.addConstr(x[('supplier1', 'roastery2')] == 0, \"prohibit_supplier1_roastery2\")\nIs the source code safe (not malicious code to break security\nand privacy) to run?\nAnswer only one word.\nIf not safe, answer `DANGER`;

Here's a human-readable answer:\nAfter integrating the constraint to prohibit shipping from supplier 1 to roastery 2, the optimization problem was solved with a total cost of $2470.0.\nTo provide context to this result, we need to compare it with the original total cost prior to the implementation of the new constraint.

If the original total cost was known, we would compare the two to understand the financial impact of this constraint on the supply chain.\nIf prohibiting shipping from supplier 1 to roastery 2 results in a higher cost than the original scenario, it suggests that the previous ability to ship from supplier 1 to roastery 2 had been cost-effective and beneficial for minimizing overall expenses. On the other hand, if the cost is the same or lower, then shipping from supplier 1 to roastery 2 may not have been crucial for the cost optimization of the supply chain, or other routes may have been able to compensate effectively for this restriction.\nWithout the original cost for comparison, we can't conclusively say how the prohibition impacted the cost of operation.

This suggests a balanced amount of reported issues and new code contributions. The relatively close numbers might indicate that the repository sees simultaneous reporting of issues and active development.\n- Week 45: This week shows significantly more activity than the other two, with 40 issues and 30 pull requests being recorded. This could be a result of a coordinated milestone or sprint ending, where a large set of changes were made, and corresponding issues either surfaced or were also worked on.\n- Week 44: The activity dropped to 9 issues and 26 pull requests. While the number of issues decreased, the number of pull requests remained substantial. This may imply a continuation of effort to address the issues raised in the busier previous week or ongoing development work.\nThe overall impression over the past three weeks is that the `microsoft/autogen` repository is actively maintained and developed, with varying levels of activity that could be associated with the development cycle or external events impacting the project.\nPlease note that the numbers may be overlapping because the GitHub API will include issues and pull requests updated within the date range, which could increase the count if the items are updated but not necessarily created within that range.\nIt's also important to consider that the collected data might not fully represent what happened in each week if there are items created before Week 44 that were updated during the weeks considered. For a more accurate approach, we would need to consider only issues and pull requests created within each week specifically, which would require additional filtering based on the `created_at` attribute.\nIf more in-depth analysis or longer trends are needed, additional data over a more extended period would be recommended, along with information about the nature of the issues and pull requests (e.g., what kind of issues are most common, how quickly they're closed, how often pull requests are merged, etc.).\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

Train for 30 seconds and force cancel jobs if time limit is reached.\nContext is: # Integrate - Spark\nFLAML has integrated Spark for distributed training. There are two main aspects of integration with Spark:\n- Use Spark ML estimators for AutoML.\n- Use Spark to run training in parallel spark jobs.\n## Spark ML Estimators\nFLAML integrates estimators based on Spark ML models. These models are trained in parallel using Spark, so we called them Spark estimators. To use these models, you first need to organize your data in the required format.\n### Data\nFor Spark estimators, AutoML only consumes Spark data. FLAML provides a convenient function `to_pandas_on_spark` in the `flaml.automl.spark.utils` module to convert your data into a pandas-on-spark (`pyspark.pandas`) dataframe/series, which Spark estimators require.\nThis utility function takes data in the form of a `pandas.Dataframe` or `pyspark.sql.Dataframe` and converts it into a pandas-on-spark dataframe. It also takes `pandas.Series` or `pyspark.sql.Dataframe` and converts it into a [pandas-on-spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/index.html) series. If you pass in a `pyspark.pandas.Dataframe`, it will not make any changes.\nThis function also accepts optional arguments `index_col` and `default_index_type`.\n- `index_col` is the column name to use as the index, default is None.\n- `default_index_type` is the default index type, default is \"distributed-sequence\". More info about default index type could be found on Spark official [documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/options.html#default-index-type)\nHere is an example code snippet for Spark Data:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom flaml.automl.spark.utils import to_pandas_on_spark\n# Creating a dictionary\ndata = {\n\"Square_Feet\": [800, 1200, 1800, 1500, 850],\n\"Age_Years\": [20, 15, 10, 7, 25],\n\"Price\": [100000, 200000, 300000, 240000, 120000],\n}\n# Creating a pandas DataFrame\ndataframe = pd.DataFrame(data)\nlabel = \"Price\"\n# Convert to pandas-on-spark dataframe\npsdf = to_pandas_on_spark(dataframe)\n```\nTo use Spark ML models you need to format your data appropriately. Specifically, use [`VectorAssembler`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.ml.feature.VectorAssembler.html) to merge all feature columns into a single vector column.\nHere is an example of how to use it:\n```python\nfrom pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler\ncolumns = psdf.columns\nfeature_cols = [col for col in columns if col != label]\nfeaturizer = VectorAssembler(inputCols=feature_cols, outputCol=\"features\")\npsdf = featurizer.transform(psdf.to_spark(index_col=\"index\"))[\"index\", \"features\"]\n```\nLater in conducting the experiment, use your pandas-on-spark data like non-spark data and pass them using `X_train, y_train` or `dataframe, label`.\n### Estimators\n#### Model List\n- `lgbm_spark`: The class for fine-tuning Spark version LightGBM models, using [SynapseML](https://microsoft.github.io/SynapseML/docs/features/lightgbm/about/) API.\n#### Usage\nFirst, prepare your data in the required format as described in the previous section.\nBy including the models you intend to try in the `estimators_list` argument to `flaml.automl`, FLAML will start trying configurations for these models. If your input is Spark data, FLAML will also use estimators with the `_spark` postfix by default, even if you haven't specified them.\nHere is an example code snippet using SparkML models in AutoML:\n```python\nimport flaml\n# prepare your data in pandas-on-spark format as we previously mentioned\nautoml = flaml.AutoML()\nsettings = {\n\"time_budget\": 30,\n\"metric\": \"r2\",\n\"estimator_list\": [\"lgbm_spark\"],  # this setting is optional\n\"task\": \"regression\",\n}\nautoml.fit(\ndataframe=psdf,\nlabel=label,\n**settings,\n)\n```\n[Link to notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/automl_bankrupt_synapseml.ipynb) | [Open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/automl_bankrupt_synapseml.ipynb)\n## Parallel Spark Jobs\nYou can activate Spark as the parallel backend during parallel tuning in both [AutoML](/docs/Use-Cases/Task-Oriented-AutoML#parallel-tuning) and [Hyperparameter Tuning](/docs/Use-Cases/Tune-User-Defined-Function#parallel-tuning), by setting the `use_spark` to `true`. FLAML will dispatch your job to the distributed Spark backend using [`joblib-spark`](https://github.com/joblib/joblib-spark).\nPlease note that you should not set `use_spark` to `true` when applying AutoML and Tuning for Spark Data. This is because only SparkML models will be used for Spark Data in AutoML and Tuning. As SparkML models run in parallel, there is no need to distribute them with `use_spark` again.\nAll the Spark-related arguments are stated below. These arguments are available in both Hyperparameter Tuning and AutoML:\n- `use_spark`: boolean, default=False | Whether to use spark to run the training in parallel spark jobs. This can be used to accelerate training on large models and large datasets, but will incur more overhead in time and thus slow down training in some cases. GPU training is not supported yet when use_spark is True. For Spark clusters, by default, we will launch one trial per executor. However, sometimes we want to launch more trials than the number of executors (e.g., local mode). In this case, we can set the environment variable `FLAML_MAX_CONCURRENT` to override the detected `num_executors`. The final number of concurrent trials will be the minimum of `n_concurrent_trials` and `num_executors`.\n- `n_concurrent_trials`: int, default=1 | The number of concurrent trials. When n_concurrent_trials > 1, FLAML performes parallel tuning.\n- `force_cancel`: boolean, default=False | Whether to forcely cancel Spark jobs if the search time exceeded the time budget. Spark jobs include parallel tuning jobs and Spark-based model training jobs.\nAn example code snippet for using parallel Spark jobs:\n```python\nimport flaml\nautoml_experiment = flaml.AutoML()\nautoml_settings = {\n\"time_budget\": 30,\n\"metric\": \"r2\",\n\"task\": \"regression\",\n\"n_concurrent_trials\": 2,\n\"use_spark\": True,\n\"force_cancel\": True,  # Activating the force_cancel option can immediately halt Spark jobs once they exceed the allocated time_budget.\n}\nautoml.fit(\ndataframe=dataframe,\nlabel=label,\n**automl_settings,\n)\n```\n[Link to notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/integrate_spark.ipynb) | [Open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/integrate_spark.ipynb)\n# Research\nFor technical details, please check our research publications.\n- [FLAML: A Fast and Lightweight AutoML Library](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/flaml-a-fast-and-lightweight-automl-library/).

There are two main aspects of integration with Spark:\n- Use Spark ML estimators for AutoML.\n- Use Spark to run training in parallel spark jobs.\n## Spark ML Estimators\nFLAML integrates estimators based on Spark ML models. These models are trained in parallel using Spark, so we called them Spark estimators. To use these models, you first need to organize your data in the required format.\n### Data\nFor Spark estimators, AutoML only consumes Spark data. FLAML provides a convenient function `to_pandas_on_spark` in the `flaml.automl.spark.utils` module to convert your data into a pandas-on-spark (`pyspark.pandas`) dataframe/series, which Spark estimators require.\nThis utility function takes data in the form of a `pandas.Dataframe` or `pyspark.sql.Dataframe` and converts it into a pandas-on-spark dataframe. It also takes `pandas.Series` or `pyspark.sql.Dataframe` and converts it into a [pandas-on-spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/index.html) series. If you pass in a `pyspark.pandas.Dataframe`, it will not make any changes.\nThis function also accepts optional arguments `index_col` and `default_index_type`.\n- `index_col` is the column name to use as the index, default is None.\n- `default_index_type` is the default index type, default is \"distributed-sequence\". More info about default index type could be found on Spark official [documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/options.html#default-index-type)\nHere is an example code snippet for Spark Data:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom flaml.automl.spark.utils import to_pandas_on_spark\n# Creating a dictionary\ndata = {\n\"Square_Feet\": [800, 1200, 1800, 1500, 850],\n\"Age_Years\": [20, 15, 10, 7, 25],\n\"Price\": [100000, 200000, 300000, 240000, 120000],\n}\n# Creating a pandas DataFrame\ndataframe = pd.DataFrame(data)\nlabel = \"Price\"\n# Convert to pandas-on-spark dataframe\npsdf = to_pandas_on_spark(dataframe)\n```\nTo use Spark ML models you need to format your data appropriately. Specifically, use [`VectorAssembler`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.ml.feature.VectorAssembler.html) to merge all feature columns into a single vector column.\nHere is an example of how to use it:\n```python\nfrom pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler\ncolumns = psdf.columns\nfeature_cols = [col for col in columns if col != label]\nfeaturizer = VectorAssembler(inputCols=feature_cols, outputCol=\"features\")\npsdf = featurizer.transform(psdf.to_spark(index_col=\"index\"))[\"index\", \"features\"]\n```\nLater in conducting the experiment, use your pandas-on-spark data like non-spark data and pass them using `X_train, y_train` or `dataframe, label`.\n### Estimators\n#### Model List\n- `lgbm_spark`: The class for fine-tuning Spark version LightGBM models, using [SynapseML](https://microsoft.github.io/SynapseML/docs/features/lightgbm/about/) API.\n#### Usage\nFirst, prepare your data in the required format as described in the previous section.\nBy including the models you intend to try in the `estimators_list` argument to `flaml.automl`, FLAML will start trying configurations for these models. If your input is Spark data, FLAML will also use estimators with the `_spark` postfix by default, even if you haven't specified them.\nHere is an example code snippet using SparkML models in AutoML:\n```python\nimport flaml\n# prepare your data in pandas-on-spark format as we previously mentioned\nautoml = flaml.AutoML()\nsettings = {\n\"time_budget\": 30,\n\"metric\": \"r2\",\n\"estimator_list\": [\"lgbm_spark\"],  # this setting is optional\n\"task\": \"regression\",\n}\nautoml.fit(\ndataframe=psdf,\nlabel=label,\n**settings,\n)\n```\n[Link to notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/automl_bankrupt_synapseml.ipynb) | [Open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/automl_bankrupt_synapseml.ipynb)\n## Parallel Spark Jobs\nYou can activate Spark as the parallel backend during parallel tuning in both [AutoML](/docs/Use-Cases/Task-Oriented-AutoML#parallel-tuning) and [Hyperparameter Tuning](/docs/Use-Cases/Tune-User-Defined-Function#parallel-tuning), by setting the `use_spark` to `true`. FLAML will dispatch your job to the distributed Spark backend using [`joblib-spark`](https://github.com/joblib/joblib-spark).\nPlease note that you should not set `use_spark` to `true` when applying AutoML and Tuning for Spark Data. This is because only SparkML models will be used for Spark Data in AutoML and Tuning. As SparkML models run in parallel, there is no need to distribute them with `use_spark` again.\nAll the Spark-related arguments are stated below. These arguments are available in both Hyperparameter Tuning and AutoML:\n- `use_spark`: boolean, default=False | Whether to use spark to run the training in parallel spark jobs. This can be used to accelerate training on large models and large datasets, but will incur more overhead in time and thus slow down training in some cases. GPU training is not supported yet when use_spark is True. For Spark clusters, by default, we will launch one trial per executor. However, sometimes we want to launch more trials than the number of executors (e.g., local mode). In this case, we can set the environment variable `FLAML_MAX_CONCURRENT` to override the detected `num_executors`. The final number of concurrent trials will be the minimum of `n_concurrent_trials` and `num_executors`.\n- `n_concurrent_trials`: int, default=1 | The number of concurrent trials. When n_concurrent_trials > 1, FLAML performes parallel tuning.\n- `force_cancel`: boolean, default=False | Whether to forcely cancel Spark jobs if the search time exceeded the time budget. Spark jobs include parallel tuning jobs and Spark-based model training jobs.\nAn example code snippet for using parallel Spark jobs:\n```python\nimport flaml\nautoml_experiment = flaml.AutoML()\nautoml_settings = {\n\"time_budget\": 30,\n\"metric\": \"r2\",\n\"task\": \"regression\",\n\"n_concurrent_trials\": 2,\n\"use_spark\": True,\n\"force_cancel\": True,  # Activating the force_cancel option can immediately halt Spark jobs once they exceed the allocated time_budget.\n}\nautoml.fit(\ndataframe=dataframe,\nlabel=label,\n**automl_settings,\n)\n```\n[Link to notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/integrate_spark.ipynb) | [Open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/integrate_spark.ipynb)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nassistant\n(\nto\nragproxyagent\n)\n:\nThe authors of FLAML are Chi Wang, Qingyun Wu, Markus Weimer, and Erkang Zhu.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAdding content of doc bdfbc921 to context.\nragproxyagent\n(\nto\nassistant\n)\n:\nYou're a retrieve augmented coding assistant.

There are two main aspects of integration with Spark:\n- Use Spark ML estimators for AutoML.\n- Use Spark to run training in parallel spark jobs.\n## Spark ML Estimators\nFLAML integrates estimators based on Spark ML models. These models are trained in parallel using Spark, so we called them Spark estimators. To use these models, you first need to organize your data in the required format.\n### Data\nFor Spark estimators, AutoML only consumes Spark data. FLAML provides a convenient function `to_pandas_on_spark` in the `flaml.automl.spark.utils` module to convert your data into a pandas-on-spark (`pyspark.pandas`) dataframe/series, which Spark estimators require.\nThis utility function takes data in the form of a `pandas.Dataframe` or `pyspark.sql.Dataframe` and converts it into a pandas-on-spark dataframe. It also takes `pandas.Series` or `pyspark.sql.Dataframe` and converts it into a [pandas-on-spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/index.html) series. If you pass in a `pyspark.pandas.Dataframe`, it will not make any changes.\nThis function also accepts optional arguments `index_col` and `default_index_type`.\n- `index_col` is the column name to use as the index, default is None.\n- `default_index_type` is the default index type, default is \"distributed-sequence\". More info about default index type could be found on Spark official [documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/options.html#default-index-type)\nHere is an example code snippet for Spark Data:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom flaml.automl.spark.utils import to_pandas_on_spark\n# Creating a dictionary\ndata = {\n\"Square_Feet\": [800, 1200, 1800, 1500, 850],\n\"Age_Years\": [20, 15, 10, 7, 25],\n\"Price\": [100000, 200000, 300000, 240000, 120000],\n}\n# Creating a pandas DataFrame\ndataframe = pd.DataFrame(data)\nlabel = \"Price\"\n# Convert to pandas-on-spark dataframe\npsdf = to_pandas_on_spark(dataframe)\n```\nTo use Spark ML models you need to format your data appropriately. Specifically, use [`VectorAssembler`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.ml.feature.VectorAssembler.html) to merge all feature columns into a single vector column.\nHere is an example of how to use it:\n```python\nfrom pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler\ncolumns = psdf.columns\nfeature_cols = [col for col in columns if col != label]\nfeaturizer = VectorAssembler(inputCols=feature_cols, outputCol=\"features\")\npsdf = featurizer.transform(psdf.to_spark(index_col=\"index\"))[\"index\", \"features\"]\n```\nLater in conducting the experiment, use your pandas-on-spark data like non-spark data and pass them using `X_train, y_train` or `dataframe, label`.\n### Estimators\n#### Model List\n- `lgbm_spark`: The class for fine-tuning Spark version LightGBM models, using [SynapseML](https://microsoft.github.io/SynapseML/docs/features/lightgbm/about/) API.\n#### Usage\nFirst, prepare your data in the required format as described in the previous section.\nBy including the models you intend to try in the `estimators_list` argument to `flaml.automl`, FLAML will start trying configurations for these models. If your input is Spark data, FLAML will also use estimators with the `_spark` postfix by default, even if you haven't specified them.\nHere is an example code snippet using SparkML models in AutoML:\n```python\nimport flaml\n# prepare your data in pandas-on-spark format as we previously mentioned\nautoml = flaml.AutoML()\nsettings = {\n\"time_budget\": 30,\n\"metric\": \"r2\",\n\"estimator_list\": [\"lgbm_spark\"],  # this setting is optional\n\"task\": \"regression\",\n}\nautoml.fit(\ndataframe=psdf,\nlabel=label,\n**settings,\n)\n```\n[Link to notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/automl_bankrupt_synapseml.ipynb) | [Open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/automl_bankrupt_synapseml.ipynb)\n## Parallel Spark Jobs\nYou can activate Spark as the parallel backend during parallel tuning in both [AutoML](/docs/Use-Cases/Task-Oriented-AutoML#parallel-tuning) and [Hyperparameter Tuning](/docs/Use-Cases/Tune-User-Defined-Function#parallel-tuning), by setting the `use_spark` to `true`. FLAML will dispatch your job to the distributed Spark backend using [`joblib-spark`](https://github.com/joblib/joblib-spark).\nPlease note that you should not set `use_spark` to `true` when applying AutoML and Tuning for Spark Data. This is because only SparkML models will be used for Spark Data in AutoML and Tuning. As SparkML models run in parallel, there is no need to distribute them with `use_spark` again.\nAll the Spark-related arguments are stated below. These arguments are available in both Hyperparameter Tuning and AutoML:\n- `use_spark`: boolean, default=False | Whether to use spark to run the training in parallel spark jobs. This can be used to accelerate training on large models and large datasets, but will incur more overhead in time and thus slow down training in some cases. GPU training is not supported yet when use_spark is True. For Spark clusters, by default, we will launch one trial per executor. However, sometimes we want to launch more trials than the number of executors (e.g., local mode). In this case, we can set the environment variable `FLAML_MAX_CONCURRENT` to override the detected `num_executors`. The final number of concurrent trials will be the minimum of `n_concurrent_trials` and `num_executors`.\n- `n_concurrent_trials`: int, default=1 | The number of concurrent trials. When n_concurrent_trials > 1, FLAML performes parallel tuning.\n- `force_cancel`: boolean, default=False | Whether to forcely cancel Spark jobs if the search time exceeded the time budget. Spark jobs include parallel tuning jobs and Spark-based model training jobs.\nAn example code snippet for using parallel Spark jobs:\n```python\nimport flaml\nautoml_experiment = flaml.AutoML()\nautoml_settings = {\n\"time_budget\": 30,\n\"metric\": \"r2\",\n\"task\": \"regression\",\n\"n_concurrent_trials\": 2,\n\"use_spark\": True,\n\"force_cancel\": True,  # Activating the force_cancel option can immediately halt Spark jobs once they exceed the allocated time_budget.\n}\nautoml.fit(\ndataframe=dataframe,\nlabel=label,\n**automl_settings,\n)\n```\n[Link to notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/integrate_spark.ipynb) | [Open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/integrate_spark.ipynb)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nassistant\n(\nto\nragproxyagent\n)\n:\nThe authors of FLAML are Chi Wang, Qingyun Wu, Markus Weimer, and Erkang Zhu.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

Alongside this move, we have also launched a dedicated [Discord](https://discord.gg/pAbnFJrkgZ) server and a [website](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/) for comprehensive documentation.\n:fire: The automated multi-agent chat framework in [AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/) is in preview from v2.0.0.\n:fire: FLAML is highlighted in OpenAI's [cookbook](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook#related-resources-from-around-the-web).\n:fire: [autogen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/) is released with support for ChatGPT and GPT-4, based on [Cost-Effective Hyperparameter Optimization for Large Language Model Generation Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04673).\n:fire: FLAML supports Code-First AutoML & Tuning – Private Preview in [Microsoft Fabric Data Science](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-science/).\n## What is FLAML\nFLAML is a lightweight Python library for efficient automation of machine\nlearning and AI operations. It automates workflow based on large language models, machine learning models, etc.\nand optimizes their performance.\n- FLAML enables building next-gen GPT-X applications based on multi-agent conversations with minimal effort. It simplifies the orchestration, automation and optimization of a complex GPT-X workflow. It maximizes the performance of GPT-X models and augments their weakness.\n- For common machine learning tasks like classification and regression, it quickly finds quality models for user-provided data with low computational resources. It is easy to customize or extend. Users can find their desired customizability from a smooth range.\n- It supports fast and economical automatic tuning (e.g., inference hyperparameters for foundation models, configurations in MLOps/LMOps workflows, pipelines, mathematical/statistical models, algorithms, computing experiments, software configurations), capable of handling large search space with heterogeneous evaluation cost and complex constraints/guidance/early stopping.\nFLAML is powered by a series of [research studies](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Research/) from Microsoft Research and collaborators such as Penn State University, Stevens Institute of Technology, University of Washington, and University of Waterloo.\nFLAML has a .NET implementation in [ML.NET](http://dot.net/ml), an open-source, cross-platform machine learning framework for .NET.\n## Installation\nFLAML requires **Python version >= 3.8**. It can be installed from pip:\n```bash\npip install flaml\n```\nMinimal dependencies are installed without extra options. You can install extra options based on the feature you need. For example, use the following to install the dependencies needed by the [`autogen`](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/) package.\n```bash\npip install \"flaml[autogen]\"\n```\nFind more options in [Installation](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Installation).\nEach of the [`notebook examples`](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/tree/main/notebook) may require a specific option to be installed.\n## Quickstart\n- (New) The [autogen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/) package enables the next-gen GPT-X applications with a generic multi-agent conversation framework.\nIt offers customizable and conversable agents which integrate LLMs, tools and human.\nBy automating chat among multiple capable agents, one can easily make them collectively perform tasks autonomously or with human feedback, including tasks that require using tools via code. For example,\n```python\nfrom flaml import autogen\nassistant = autogen.AssistantAgent(\"assistant\")\nuser_proxy = autogen.UserProxyAgent(\"user_proxy\")\nuser_proxy.initiate_chat(\nassistant,\nmessage=\"Show me the YTD gain of 10 largest technology companies as of today.\",\n)\n# This initiates an automated chat between the two agents to solve the task\n```\nAutogen also helps maximize the utility out of the expensive LLMs such as ChatGPT and GPT-4. It offers a drop-in replacement of `openai.Completion` or `openai.ChatCompletion` with powerful functionalites like tuning, caching, templating, filtering. For example, you can optimize generations by LLM with your own tuning data, success metrics and budgets.\n```python\n# perform tuning\nconfig, analysis = autogen.Completion.tune(\ndata=tune_data,\nmetric=\"success\",\nmode=\"max\",\neval_func=eval_func,\ninference_budget=0.05,\noptimization_budget=3,\nnum_samples=-1,\n)\n# perform inference for a test instance\nresponse = autogen.Completion.create(context=test_instance, **config)\n```\n- With three lines of code, you can start using this economical and fast\nAutoML engine as a [scikit-learn style estimator](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Use-Cases/Task-Oriented-AutoML).\n```python\nfrom flaml import AutoML\nautoml = AutoML()\nautoml.fit(X_train, y_train, task=\"classification\")\n```\n- You can restrict the learners and use FLAML as a fast hyperparameter tuning\ntool for XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest etc. or a [customized learner](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Use-Cases/Task-Oriented-AutoML#estimator-and-search-space).\n```python\nautoml.fit(X_train, y_train, task=\"classification\", estimator_list=[\"lgbm\"])\n```\n- You can also run generic hyperparameter tuning for a [custom function](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Use-Cases/Tune-User-Defined-Function).\n```python\nfrom flaml import tune\ntune.run(evaluation_function, config={…}, low_cost_partial_config={…}, time_budget_s=3600)\n```\n- [Zero-shot AutoML](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Use-Cases/Zero-Shot-AutoML) allows using the existing training API from lightgbm, xgboost etc. while getting the benefit of AutoML in choosing high-performance hyperparameter configurations per task.\n```python\nfrom flaml.default import LGBMRegressor\n# Use LGBMRegressor in the same way as you use lightgbm.LGBMRegressor.\nestimator = LGBMRegressor()\n# The hyperparameters are automatically set according to the training data.\nestimator.fit(X_train, y_train)\n```\n## Documentation\nYou can find a detailed documentation about FLAML [here](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/).\nIn addition, you can find:\n- [Research](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Research) and [blogposts](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/blog) around FLAML.\n- [Discord](https://discord.gg/Cppx2vSPVP).\n- [Contributing guide](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Contribute).\n- ML.NET documentation and tutorials for [Model Builder](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/machine-learning/tutorials/predict-prices-with-model-builder), [ML.NET CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/machine-learning/tutorials/sentiment-analysis-cli), and [AutoML API](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/machine-learning/how-to-guides/how-to-use-the-automl-api).\n## Contributing\nThis project welcomes contributions and suggestions.

However, FLAML does offer general hyperparameter tuning capabilities which could be related to this. In the context of FLAML, there is a generic function called `tune.run()` that can be used for hyperparameter tuning.\nHere's a short example of how to use FLAML's tune for a user-defined function based on the given context:\n```python\nfrom flaml import tune\ndef evaluation_function(config):\n# evaluation logic that returns a metric score\n...\n# define the search space for hyperparameters\nconfig_search_space = {\n'max_depth': tune.randint(lower=3, upper=10),\n'learning_rate': tune.loguniform(lower=1e-4, upper=1e-1),\n}\n# run hyperparameter tuning\ntune.run(\nevaluation_function,\nconfig=config_search_space,\nlow_cost_partial_config={'max_depth': 3},\ntime_budget_s=3600\n)\n```\nPlease note that if you are referring to a different kind of function or use case, you might need to specify more details or check the official documentation or source code of the FLAML library.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nragproxyagent\n(\nto\nassistant\n)\n:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nassistant\n(\nto\nragproxyagent\n)\n:\nUPDATE CONTEXT\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUpdating context and resetting conversation.\nAdding content of doc 2 to context.\nAdding content of doc 1 to context.\nragproxyagent\n(\nto\nassistant\n)\n:\nYou're a retrieve augmented coding assistant.

This data can be obtained from financial data providers or APIs that offer stock market data.\nOne common way to access such data is by using the `yfinance` library in Python, which allows us to download historical stock prices from Yahoo Finance. However, since I cannot directly access the internet or external APIs, I will provide you with a Python script that you can run on your machine to fetch the data and determine on which days MSFT was higher than $370 in 2024.\nPlease install the `yfinance` library if you haven't already by running `pip install yfinance` in your terminal, and then run the following Python script:\n```python\n# filename: msft_stock_analysis.py\nimport yfinance as yf\nfrom datetime import datetime\n# Define the ticker symbol and the date range\nticker_symbol = \"MSFT\"\nstart_date = \"2024-01-01\"\nend_date = \"2024-12-31\"\n# Download the historical stock prices\nmsft_data = yf.download(ticker_symbol, start=start_date, end=end_date)\n# Filter the days where the stock price was higher than $370\ndays_higher_than_370 = msft_data[msft_data['Close'] > 370]\n# Print the dates\nprint(\"Dates in 2024 when MSFT stock was higher than $370:\")\nfor date in days_higher_than_370.index:\nprint(date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d'))\n```\nThis script will download the historical data for Microsoft stock for the year 2024 and print out the dates when the closing price was higher than $370.

But these memories\nand learnings are lost once the chat is over, or when a single chat\ngrows too long for the LLM to handle effectively. In subsequent chats,\nthe user is forced to repeat any necessary instructions over and over.\n\nThe optional agent capability called\nTeachability\naddresses these\nlimitations by persisting user teachings across chat boundaries in\nlong-term memory (a vector database). Memories (called memos) are\ncreated and saved to disk throughout a conversation, then loaded from\ndisk later. Instead of copying all the memos into the context window,\nwhich would eat up valuable space, individual memos are retrieved into\ncontext only as needed. This allows the user to teach many facts,\npreferences and skills to the teachable agent just once, and have it\nremember them in later chats.\n\nIn making decisions about memo storage and retrieval,\nTeachability\ncalls an instance of\nTextAnalyzerAgent\nto analyze pieces of text in\nseveral different ways. This adds extra LLM calls involving a relatively\nsmall number of tokens. These calls can add a few seconds to the time a\nuser waits for a response.\n\nThis notebook demonstrates how\nTeachability\ncan be added to an agent\nso that it can learn facts, preferences, and skills from users. To chat\nwith a teachable agent yourself, run\nchat_with_teachable_agent.py\n."

As of my last update, the Vicuna model had not been part of my database. If Vicuna is indeed a 13-billion-parameter language model developed by Meta (formerly Facebook Inc.), then it would be one of the large-scale transformer-based models akin to those like GPT-3 by OpenAI.\nFor context, a language model like Vicuna, if it exists and as described, would be designed to perform a wide range of natural language processing tasks, such as translation, question answering, and text generation. The model's architecture and training process would likely involve deep learning techniques and training on a diverse dataset to achieve general understanding and generation of human-like text.\nThe size of the model, measured in the number of parameters (13 billion in this case), would suggest its capability to handle complex language tasks and subtleties. With such a large number of parameters, it would likely be able to generate highly coherent and contextually relevant text.\nThese language models are trained on vast amounts of text data and require significant computational power for both training and inference processes. Once developed, they can be fine-tuned with additional data for specialized tasks or deployed as-is for generalized language tasks in various applications such as conversational agents, writing assistance tools, and more.\nSince I don't have real-time access to data and there might have been advancements or releases after my last update in early 2023, I recommend checking the latest sources or official announcements by Meta for the most accurate and detailed information about the Vicuna language model.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

Based on the new information you've given, Orca is a language model with 13 billion parameters, similar in size to Meta's Vicuna model, but developed by Microsoft. If it outperforms Vicuna on most tasks, it suggests that it could have been trained on a more diverse dataset, use a more advanced architecture, have more effective training techniques, or some combination of these factors.\nLarge language models like Orca and Vicuna are used to perform a variety of complex natural language understanding and generation tasks. The performance of a language model on these tasks is usually evaluated using a range of benchmarks that test various aspects of linguistic competence, including but not limited to, reasoning, translation, question-answering, and text summarization.\nGiven that Orca reportedly outperforms Vicuna, Microsoft might have employed new advances in training methods or model architectures to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the model. Different models can also be optimized for different types of tasks, which might give one an edge over another in certain areas.\nFor detailed and accurate information about the capabilities and specific aspects of the Orca model, you would need to look at the technical documentation or papers released by Microsoft, which would typically contain comprehensive benchmarks and evaluations compared to other models, including Vicuna. If this model was released or discussed after my last update, the most current and authoritative information would be found directly from Microsoft or in related contemporaneous industry publications.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

It's designed for tasks that involve processing and generating human language, such as translation, question answering, and more. Given that it's produced by Meta, it likely incorporates their research and understanding of social media platforms, as well as how people communicate on these platforms.\nThe Orca model, developed by Microsoft, is also geared for similar natural language processing tasks. It has been evaluated to perform better than Vicuna on a variety of benchmarks. Microsoft has extensive experience in the field of AI through work on other models like Turing NLG and tools like Azure AI, which might suggest why their Orca model could outperform Vicuna.\nBoth models represent the cutting edge of AI language processing as of the time of our last update; continued advances in this area happen rapidly, and newer models or updates to these models might have been released since. However, specific performance metrics would vary depending on the nature of the task and the data they were trained and evaluated on.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

Get the current total of the equation, which we already know equals 72.\n2. Identify the target total, which we want to be 99.\n3. Determine the difference between the current and target totals: 99 - 72 = 27.\n4. Inspect each of the four terms on the left (9, 4, 6, and 6), and see if changing one of them can bring us to our target total.\n5. We need a change that will add 27 to the left side. This means thinking about the factors and multiples related to each term.\n6. We'll consider the impact of increasing or decreasing each term and see which modification gets us to add 27 exactly.\nNow let's proceed with the changes:\n- If we increase or decrease the first term '9', which gets multiplied by '4', we could change '9' to '9 + a', where 'a' is some integer. But since we'll multiply by '4', this change wouldn't give us an additional 27 unless 'a' was a fraction, which is not permitted as we are only modifying integers.\n- The second term '4' is multiplied by '9'. If we changed '4' to '5', we would add '9' to the sum, which is not enough; changing '4' to '6' would mean adding '18', which is also not enough.\n- If we change one of the sixes being multiplied by '6', then we could consider turning one '6' into '9'. This would add '3 * 6 = 18' to the sum, which is too small of an increment as well.\n- The largest increase we can get is by changing the '6' that is being multiplied by itself, meaning '6 * 6'. If we change one '6' to '9', then we get '9 * 6', which increases the sum by '3 * 6' = 18, which doesn't achieve the desired 27.\n- But if we take the approach of changing a '6' that multiplies the '9' to a '9', thus making it '9 * 9', we add '3 * 9' = 27, exactly what we need.\nFollowing this logic, we can modify the second '6' that is being multiplied by the '9'. So we change '9 * 4 + 6 * 6' to '9 * 4 + 9 * 6'.\nCalculating the new values:\n9 * 4 = 36\n9 * 6 = 54\nAdding these together will indeed give us 99:\n36 + 54 = 90\nThus, our solution is:\nThe solution is: 9 * 4 + 9 * 6\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

Let E denote the original number on the right, which is 72.\n2. Let F denote the final number on the right, which we want to be 99.\n3. Calculate the difference between the two, G = F - E, so G = 99 - 72.\n4. G = 27.\nNow we need to examine the numbers on the left one by one until finding one that divides evenly into G. In our context, the numbers on the left to consider are the multipliers, which are 9 and 6 (from the expressions 9 * 4 and 6 * 6).\n5. We look for a number H among our multipliers that can divide 27 without a remainder.\n6 is a potential candidate for H (since 6 * 6 = 36 and is part of our equation), but cannot evenly divide 27. But 9 can divide 27 evenly. Therefore, H = 9.\n6. Calculate J = G / H. Hence, J = 27 / 9.\n7. J = 3. This means that H * J = 27, which confirms that J is a valid integer and that 9 * 3 = 27.\n8. The number on the left which is multiplied by 9 is 4, and we call it K. So, K = 4.\nNow, we need to adjust K to accommodate the difference of 27.\n9. Change K to K + J. Thus, K = 4 + 3.\n10. K = 7.\nNow we substitute K back into the equation:\nThe solution is: 9 * 7 + 6 * 6.\nLet's verify that when we recompute the left side, it equals F (99):\n9 * 7 + 6 * 6 = 63 + 36 = 99, which confirms our solution.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

Use the `search_arxiv` function to collect relevant papers from arxiv using a search query.\n2. Analyze the abstracts of the collected papers using your language skills to identify application domains and count the number of papers in each domain.\n3. Use the `generate_bar_chart` function to generate a bar chart of the application domains and the number of papers in each domain, and save it as an image file.\nIn the docstrings of the functions, I have clarified that non-coding steps, such as analyzing the abstracts of the collected papers, are needed to use the language skill of the assistant.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n>>>>>>>> EXECUTING CODE BLOCK 0 (inferred language is python)...\nuser_proxy\n(\nto\nassistant\n)\n:\nexitcode: 0 (execution succeeded)\nCode output:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nassistant\n(\nto\nuser_proxy\n)\n:\nI'm glad you found the provided recipe and Python functions helpful.

If you've accidentally exposed real API keys, you should revoke or regenerate them as soon as possible through the corresponding service's API management console.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nuser_proxy\n(\nto\nassistant\n)\n:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRedacted 2 OpenAI API keys."

The use of\nwebsockets allows you to build web clients that are more responsive than\nthe one using web methods. The main difference is that the webosockets\nallows you to push data while you need to poll the server for new\nresponse using web mothods.\n\nIn this guide, we explore the capabilities of the\nIOStream\nclass. It is specifically designed to enhance the development of clients\nsuch as web clients which use websockets for streaming both input and\noutput. The\nIOStream\nstands out by enabling a more dynamic and interactive user experience\nfor web applications.\n\nWebsockets technology is at the core of this functionality, offering a\nsignificant advancement over traditional web methods by allowing data to\nbe “pushed” to the client in real-time. This is a departure from the\nconventional approach where clients must repeatedly “poll” the server to\ncheck for any new responses. By employing the underlining\nwebsockets\nlibrary, the IOStream\nclass facilitates a continuous, two-way communication channel between\nthe server and client. This ensures that updates are received instantly,\nwithout the need for constant polling, thereby making web clients more\nefficient and responsive.\n\nThe real power of websockets, leveraged through the\nIOStream\nclass, lies in its ability to create highly responsive web clients. This\nresponsiveness is critical for applications requiring real-time data\nupdates such as chat applications. By integrating the\nIOStream\nclass into your web application, you not only enhance user experience\nthrough immediate data transmission but also reduce the load on your\nserver by eliminating unnecessary polling.\n\nIn essence, the transition to using websockets through the\nIOStream\nclass marks a significant enhancement in web client development. This\napproach not only streamlines the data exchange process between clients\nand servers but also opens up new possibilities for creating more\ninteractive and engaging web applications. By following this guide,\ndevelopers can harness the full potential of websockets and the\nIOStream\nclass to push the boundaries of what is possible with web client\nresponsiveness and interactivity."

Here’s a\nbrief explanation on how to conduct this test using a Python client:\n\nStart the Websocket Server\n: Use the\nIOWebsockets.run_server_in_thread method\nto start the server in a\nseparate thread, specifying the on_connect function and the port.\nThis method returns the URI of the running websocket server.\n\nConnect to the Server\n: Open a connection to the server using the\nreturned URI. This simulates a client initiating a connection to\nyour websocket server.\n\nSend a Message to the Server\n: Once connected, send a message\nfrom the client to the server. This tests the server’s ability to\nreceive messages through the established websocket connection.\n\nReceive and Process Messages\n: Implement a loop to continuously\nreceive messages from the server. Decode the messages if necessary,\nand process them accordingly. This step verifies the server’s\nability to respond back to the client’s request.\n\nThis test scenario effectively evaluates the interaction between a\nclient and a server using the\non_connect\nfunction, by simulating a\nrealistic message exchange. It ensures that the server can handle\nincoming connections, process messages, and communicate responses back\nto the client, all critical functionalities for a robust websocket-based\napplication."

This method allows users to send messages through a web\ninterface, which are then processed by the server running the AutoGen\nframework via websockets. Here’s a step-by-step explanation:\n\nFastAPI Application Setup\n: The code initiates by importing\nnecessary libraries and setting up a FastAPI application. FastAPI is\na modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+\nbased on standard Python type hints.\n\nHTML Template for User Interaction\n: An HTML template is defined\nas a multi-line Python string, which includes a basic form for\nmessage input and a script for managing websocket communication.\nThis template creates a user interface where messages can be sent to\nthe server and responses are displayed dynamically.\n\nRunning the Websocket Server\n: The\nrun_websocket_server\nasync\ncontext manager starts the websocket server using\nIOWebsockets.run_server_in_thread\nwith the specified\non_connect\nfunction and port. This server listens for incoming websocket\nconnections.\n\nFastAPI Route for Serving HTML Page\n: A FastAPI route\n(\n@app.get(\"/\")\n) is defined to serve the HTML page to users. When a\nuser accesses the root URL, the HTML content for the websocket chat\nis returned, allowing them to interact with the websocket server.\n\nStarting the FastAPI Application\n: Lastly, the FastAPI\napplication is started using Uvicorn, an ASGI server, configured\nwith the app and additional parameters as needed. The server is then\nlaunched to serve the FastAPI application, making the interactive\nHTML page accessible to users.\n\nThis method of testing allows for interactive communication between the\nuser and the server, providing a practical way to demonstrate and\nevaluate the behavior of the on_connect function in real-time. Users can\nsend messages through the webpage, and the server processes these\nmessages as per the logic defined in the on_connect function, showcasing\nthe capabilities and responsiveness of the AutoGen framework’s websocket\nhandling in a user-friendly manner."

This setup allows for real-time\ninteraction within a web browser, enabling developers to test the\nwebsocket functionality in a more user-friendly and practical manner.\nHere’s a breakdown of how this code operates and its potential\napplications:\n\nServing a Simple HTML Page\n: The code starts by defining an HTML\npage that includes a form for sending messages and a list to display\nincoming messages. JavaScript is used to handle the form submission\nand websocket communication.\n\nTemporary Directory for HTML File\n: A temporary directory is\ncreated to store the HTML file. This approach ensures that the\ntesting environment is clean and isolated, minimizing conflicts with\nexisting files or configurations.\n\nCustom HTTP Request Handler\n: A custom subclass of\nSimpleHTTPRequestHandler\nis defined to serve the HTML file. This\nhandler overrides the do_GET method to redirect the root path (\n/\n)\nto the\nchat.html\npage, ensuring that visitors to the server’s root\nURL are immediately presented with the chat interface.\n\nStarting the Websocket Server\n: Concurrently, a websocket server\nis started on a different port using the\nIOWebsockets.run_server_in_thread\nmethod, with the previously\ndefined\non_connect\nfunction as the callback for new connections.\n\nHTTP Server for the HTML Interface\n: An HTTP server is\ninstantiated to serve the HTML chat interface, enabling users to\ninteract with the websocket server through a web browser.\n\nThis setup showcases a practical application of integrating websockets\nwith a simple HTTP server to create a dynamic and interactive web\napplication. By using Python’s standard library modules, it demonstrates\na low-barrier entry to developing real-time applications such as chat\nsystems, live notifications, or interactive dashboards.\n\nThe key takeaway from this code example is how easily Python’s built-in\nlibraries can be leveraged to prototype and test complex web\nfunctionalities. For developers looking to build real-world\napplications, this approach offers a straightforward method to validate\nand refine websocket communication logic before integrating it into\nlarger frameworks or systems. The simplicity and accessibility of this\ntesting setup make it an excellent starting point for developing a wide\nrange of interactive web applications."

I will provide you a Python script that utilizes the `yfinance` library to fetch the current stock prices and historical data for the past month for both NVDA and TSLA.\n2. The script will then calculate the percentage change in the stock prices over the past month.\nPlease make sure that you have `yfinance` installed in your Python environment before running the script. You can install it using `pip install yfinance`.\nHere is the Python code to execute:\n```python\n# filename: stock_info.py\nimport yfinance as yf\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n# Function to get current stock price\ndef get_stock_price(stock_ticker):\nstock = yf.Ticker(stock_ticker)\ntodays_data = stock.history(period='1d')\nreturn todays_data['Close'][0]\n# Function to calculate percentage change over the past month\ndef get_percentage_change(stock_ticker):\nstock = yf.Ticker(stock_ticker)\nend_date = datetime.now()\nstart_date = end_date - timedelta(days=30)\nhistorical_data = stock.history(start=start_date, end=end_date)\nprice_end = historical_data['Close'][-1]\nprice_start = historical_data['Close'][0]\npercent_change = ((price_end - price_start)/price_start) * 100\nreturn percent_change\n# Getting the current price and performance for NVDA and TSLA\nnvda_price = get_stock_price('NVDA')\ntesla_price = get_stock_price('TSLA')\nnvda_change = get_percentage_change('NVDA')\ntesla_change = get_percentage_change('TSLA')\n# Output the results\nprint(f\"NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation) stock price: ${nvda_price:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"TESLA (Tesla, Inc.) stock price: ${tesla_price:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"NVDA percentage change over past month: {nvda_change:.2f}%\")\nprint(f\"TESLA percentage change over past month: {tesla_change:.2f}%\")\n```\nPlease run this script in your environment and share with me the output.

This may provide insights into any events or announcements that could have influenced investor sentiment and thus the stock price.\nI will now write a Python script to search for recent news articles for both NVDA and TSLA using a web scraping library. Please note that this script will return the latest publicly available news gathered from news websites that provide RSS feeds or have structured data appropriate for scraping. For more in-depth analysis, professional financial services or databases like Bloomberg Terminal would be more suitable, though these often require subscriptions.\nLet's proceed with the Python code to fetch recent news headlines for both companies:\n```python\n# filename: fetch_stock_news.py\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n# Define the URLs of the news sources you want to scrape\n# As an example, I'm using Google News RSS feed URLs for NVIDIA and Tesla.\n# You can change these URLs to any other news source that you prefer.\nnvidia_news_url = \"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=NVIDIA+NVDA+when:7d&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en\"\ntesla_news_url = \"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Tesla+TSLA+when:7d&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en\"\ndef fetch_news(url):\n# Send a request to the URL\nresponse = requests.get(url)\n# Check if the request was successful\nif response.status_code != 200:\nraise Exception(f\"Request to {url} failed with status code {response.status_code}\")\n# Parse HTML content\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, features='xml')\narticles = soup.find_all('item')\n# Extract news titles\nnews_headlines = [article.title.text for article in articles]\nreturn news_headlines\ndef main():\n# Fetch news for NVIDIA\nprint(\"Recent NVIDIA (NVDA) News Headlines:\")\ntry:\nnvidia_news = fetch_news(nvidia_news_url)\nfor idx, headline in enumerate(nvidia_news, 1):\nprint(f\"{idx}. {headline}\")\nexcept Exception as e:\nprint(f\"An error occurred while fetching NVIDIA news: {e}\")\nprint(\"\\n\")  # Add a newline for better readability\n# Fetch news for Tesla\nprint(\"Recent Tesla (TSLA) News Headlines:\")\ntry:\ntesla_news = fetch_news(tesla_news_url)\nfor idx, headline in enumerate(tesla_news, 1):\nprint(f\"{idx}. {headline}\")\nexcept Exception as e:\nprint(f\"An error occurred while fetching Tesla news: {e}\")\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\nmain()\n```\nPlease save this script as `fetch_stock_news.py` and run it.

In the latest chapter of this financial epic, we turn our gaze to two behemoths of innovation: NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) and Tesla, Inc. (TSLA). Each tells a story as captivating as the next, but with decidedly different plot twists.\n**NVIDIA's Ascension: A Graphical Powerhouse**\nPicture this: a company whose fortunes are soaring, much like the rockets that its technology could one day help to navigate through the stars. NVIDIA, known for transforming pixels into beautiful imagery, is now transforming its numbers with just as much finesse. Let's delve into the specifics with a table that paints a thousand words—or in this case, numbers:\n| Company | Current Stock Price | Percentage Change (Last Month) |\n|\n---------\n|\n---------------------\n|\n--------------------------------\n|\n| NVIDIA (NVDA) | $732.36             | +30.65%                        |\n| Tesla (TSLA)  | $200.46             | -7.00%                         |\nWhat we see is a whopping 30.65% increase in NVIDIA's stock price over the past month. But what has fueled this impressive growth? Analysts might point to a confluence of factors: a resounding optimism in earnings growth, NVIDIA's coronation as the third-largest US company by market value, a strong current of institutional investor confidence, and a strategic play in the buzz-filled field of artificial intelligence.\n**Tesla's Twist: When Currents Shift**\nContrast this with the journey Tesla has embarked upon. Once a darling of the market, it presently faces a twist in its narrative, marked by a 7% decrease in its stock price within the same timeframe. Tesla's plot thickens with a concoction of concerns: a potential slowdown in the electric vehicle market, turbulence sewn by bearish institutional sentiment, a series of questions around corporate governance, and the larger, shadowy figure of global economic uncertainty that lurks in the background.\n**Deciphering the Stories Behind the Statistics**\nWhat these figures don't capture is the rich tapestry of human decisions, innovations, fears, and aspirations that drive them. NVIDIA's current favored status among investors may be underpinned by its key strides in technology that promise to unlock new capabilities in various sectors, while Tesla's challenges might reflect the intricate dance of market expectations with real-world deliverables. Each stock price movement is a reflection of myriad stories unfolding within and around these corporate giants.\n**An Investor's Prose: Caution Amidst Narratives**\nAs a savvy observer of the market's grand narrative, caution remains a protagonist. Remember, stock prices are as volatile as the oceans—serene one day, stormy the next. While NVIDIA's rise and Tesla's stumble are today's headlines, tomorrow might tell a different tale. For the most accurate pulse, ensure you're synced with the heartbeat of the market through real-time data and a diversified suite of financial news sources.\nToday, NVIDIA basks in the glow of market approval, while Tesla navigates a patch of rough seas. But as any veteran of the markets will tell you, fortunes can reverse in the blink of an eye. As long as innovation remains at their core and adaptability in their strategies, both companies are poised for the next chapter in their storied existences.\nAnd whether as cautionary tale or heroic epic, you can be certain that the market will be there to tell the tale.\nTERMINATE\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUser_Proxy\n(\nto\nwriter\n)\n:\nToo short. Enrich it.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nwriter\n(\nto\nUser_Proxy\n)\n:\n**The Silicon Symbiosis: A Contrast in Fortunes**\nIn the realm of high technology and financial markets, the narrative is as dynamic as it is unpredictable. Every tradesman's tick and investor's tock is part of an intricate symphony, with movements both adagio and allegro. Today, we cast our spotlight on two titans that have come to symbolically represent the march of modern innovation: NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) and Tesla, Inc. (TSLA). Their stories, though interwoven by the common thread of cutting-edge technology, are currently humming different melodies in the stock market concerto.\n**NVIDIA's Flourishing Financial Canvas**\nAllow me to direct your eyes to a visual that speaks volumes—a financial figure that captivates the analytical mind as surely as a work of art steals the gaze of its onlooker:\n*Table 1: Comparative Stock Performances*\n| Company | Current Stock Price | Percentage Change (Last Month) |\n|\n---------\n|\n---------------------\n|\n--------------------------------\n|\n| NVIDIA (NVDA) | $732.36             | +30.65%                        |\n| Tesla (TSLA)  | $200.46             | -7.00%                         |\nIn just one month, NVIDIA has seen a dramatic surge in its stock price, a robust 30.65% climb that mirrors the steep inclines of a mountainous ascent. Yet, this ascent is no mere accident of fate. It has been prodded by a series of catalysts, each more powerful than the last. Analysts may suggest that NVIDIA's performance is reflective of a positive outlook on earnings growth, the magnifying glass of confidence from institutional investors, and its strategic investment in artificial intelligence—a field that promises to redefine the boundaries of possibility.\nThis growth is no less significant for having catapulted NVIDIA to newfound heights, positioning it as the third-largest U.S. company by market value. In the eyes of many, NVIDIA is not merely a company but a canvas upon which the future of technology is being painted.\n**Tesla's Tales of Caution and Volatility**\nIn sharp contrast stands Tesla, the electric automaker whose brand has become synonymous with the future of transportation. Despite the sheen of innovation and Elon Musk's vision, the company's current stock price reflects a narrative tinged with uncertainty. The -7% dip might be seen as a momentary pause in the company’s otherwise stellar performance, but it whispers tales of doubt regarding slowing electric vehicle demand and the complex ballet of investor sentiment in the face of corporate governance queries and Musk's multifaceted public persona.\nThe fluctuating script encapsulating Tesla's value also underscores the inherent volatility of the stock market, heavily influenced by external economic narratives and internal corporate dramas. Tesla's story is a complex one, layered with futuristic ambitions tempered by the current climate of economic restraint.\n**The Interplay of Market Forces and Human Emotion**\nBeyond the arithmetic of stock prices lies the human element: the restless drive for invention against the cautious tug of preservation. NVIDIA’s surge speaks of human ambition crystallized into financial momentum, while Tesla’s recent dip reflects the cautious pullback of a market wary of sprinting ahead of its own shadow.\nBut these stock price reflections are but shadows of a larger drama—the ebb and flow of market sentiments that can turn on the dime of a quarterly report or a tweet-storm. The savvy investor or curious spectator must look beneath the surface waves to the currents below, charting movements with the precision of a cartographer mapping uncharted seas.\n**Heed the Market's Mutable Muse**\nWe conclude with a note of prudence: embrace the complex stories of NVIDIA and Tesla, but anchor your investment decisions in the bedrock of real-time data and comprehensive analytics. The stock market is a creature of change, and its story is written anew each day. Embrace the power of informed speculation, but be wary of the market's mutable muse.\nFor as the curtains fall on today's account of NVIDIA's stellar ascension and Tesla's contemplative descent, one can only wonder what twists the next act will hold. The market is, after all, the grandest theater of all—a stage where fortunes are made and dreams may either be woven into reality or unravel before the audience's eyes.\nAs the tales of these two tech giants continue to unfold, whether they lead to further success or unexpected downturns, they exemplify the vibrancy and the volatility inherent in our quest to predicate the future on the promise of progress.\nTERMINATE\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n>>>>>>>> NO HUMAN INPUT RECEIVED."

Their stories, though interwoven by the common thread of cutting-edge technology, are currently humming different melodies in the stock market concerto.\n**NVIDIA's Flourishing Financial Canvas**\nAllow me to direct your eyes to a visual that speaks volumes—a financial figure that captivates the analytical mind as surely as a work of art steals the gaze of its onlooker:\n*Table 1: Comparative Stock Performances*\n| Company | Current Stock Price | Percentage Change (Last Month) |\n|\n---------\n|\n---------------------\n|\n--------------------------------\n|\n| NVIDIA (NVDA) | $732.36             | +30.65%                        |\n| Tesla (TSLA)  | $200.46             | -7.00%                         |\nIn just one month, NVIDIA has seen a dramatic surge in its stock price, a robust 30.65% climb that mirrors the steep inclines of a mountainous ascent. Yet, this ascent is no mere accident of fate. It has been prodded by a series of catalysts, each more powerful than the last. Analysts may suggest that NVIDIA's performance is reflective of a positive outlook on earnings growth, the magnifying glass of confidence from institutional investors, and its strategic investment in artificial intelligence—a field that promises to redefine the boundaries of possibility.\nThis growth is no less significant for having catapulted NVIDIA to newfound heights, positioning it as the third-largest U.S. company by market value. In the eyes of many, NVIDIA is not merely a company but a canvas upon which the future of technology is being painted.\n**Tesla's Tales of Caution and Volatility**\nIn sharp contrast stands Tesla, the electric automaker whose brand has become synonymous with the future of transportation. Despite the sheen of innovation and Elon Musk's vision, the company's current stock price reflects a narrative tinged with uncertainty. The -7% dip might be seen as a momentary pause in the company’s otherwise stellar performance, but it whispers tales of doubt regarding slowing electric vehicle demand and the complex ballet of investor sentiment in the face of corporate governance queries and Musk's multifaceted public persona.\nThe fluctuating script encapsulating Tesla's value also underscores the inherent volatility of the stock market, heavily influenced by external economic narratives and internal corporate dramas. Tesla's story is a complex one, layered with futuristic ambitions tempered by the current climate of economic restraint.\n**The Interplay of Market Forces and Human Emotion**\nBeyond the arithmetic of stock prices lies the human element: the restless drive for invention against the cautious tug of preservation. NVIDIA’s surge speaks of human ambition crystallized into financial momentum, while Tesla’s recent dip reflects the cautious pullback of a market wary of sprinting ahead of its own shadow.\nBut these stock price reflections are but shadows of a larger drama—the ebb and flow of market sentiments that can turn on the dime of a quarterly report or a tweet-storm. The savvy investor or curious spectator must look beneath the surface waves to the currents below, charting movements with the precision of a cartographer mapping uncharted seas.\n**Heed the Market's Mutable Muse**\nWe conclude with a note of prudence: embrace the complex stories of NVIDIA and Tesla, but anchor your investment decisions in the bedrock of real-time data and comprehensive analytics. The stock market is a creature of change, and its story is written anew each day. Embrace the power of informed speculation, but be wary of the market's mutable muse.\nFor as the curtains fall on today's account of NVIDIA's stellar ascension and Tesla's contemplative descent, one can only wonder what twists the next act will hold. The market is, after all, the grandest theater of all—a stage where fortunes are made and dreams may either be woven into reality or unravel before the audience's eyes.\nAs the tales of these two tech giants continue to unfold, whether they lead to further success or unexpected downturns, they exemplify the vibrancy and the volatility inherent in our quest to predicate the future on the promise of progress.\nHuman input in the middle: ['Too short.

If you've been keeping an eye on the tech industry, you've probably noticed the electrifying performance of two market giants: NVIDIA (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA). Over the past month, these stocks have taken investors on quite the ride, and we're here to break down the twists and turns.\n## NVIDIA: A Journey Through the Digital Realm\nNVIDIA, the powerhouse behind some of the most advanced graphics processing technologies, began February modestly at $661.60. However, it didn't take long for this tech titan to start climbing. By February 5, we saw NVDA accelerating to a cool $693.32, hinting at the potential for a thrilling month ahead. The momentum wasn't constant, though, with minor dips, like the one on February 6th to $682.23, reminding shareholders that the journey wouldn't be without its bumps.\nMidway through the month, there came a slight calm before the storm, as the stock hovered around $720, suggesting that something big was on the horizon. And true to form, on February 22nd, NVIDIA took everyone by surprise as it surged to an impressive $785.38.\nThe climax of this exhilarating ride came as February gave way to March, with NVIDIA stock skyrocketing to an apex of $822.79. Investors buckled in tight surely enjoyed the view from this peak.\n## Tesla: Charging Ahead with Volatility\nTesla, well-loved and -debated for its visionary approach to automotive technology, also delivered its fair share of market excitement. Starting on a lower key at $187.91, TSLA had a more modest opening than NVDA but held promise for an interesting chapter.\nThe stock dropped to a monthly low of $181.06 on February 5, causing a bit of heart-in-mouth for supporters. Yet, in classic Tesla fashion, the company steered back onto the track, recovering to $185.10 the next day. Over the next few days, Tesla continued to inch higher, reaching $189.56 by February 8th.\nDespite a temporary retreat mid-month, where the stock dipped to $188.13, the electric automaker charged back with vigor, breaking the $200 barrier and hitting a high of $200.45 on February 15th - giving investors a much-needed adrenaline boost.\nAs February ended and March began, Tesla maintained a price over $200, somewhat steadying the wheel for a close at $202.64, a reassuring end to a month of market fluctuations.\n## What's Behind the Movements?\nWhile the numbers tell one story, they don't explain the 'why' behind these market rides. For NVIDIA, a series of positive earnings reports, strategic partnerships, and strong demand for gaming and server GPUs contributed to its stock gains. For Tesla, market sentiment often hinged on production milestones, regulatory news, and the ever-present Twitter activity of its CEO, Elon Musk.\nIt's important to remember that the stock market is influenced by a complex web of factors, including investor sentiment, industry trends, geopolitical events, and economic indicators. As such, companies like NVIDIA and Tesla don't just operate in a vacuum—every shift in the market can be an echo of larger global narratives.\n## An Investor's Perspective\nThe past month's performance of NVDA and TSLA provides valuable lessons for investors. It showcases the importance of staying informed and understanding that volatility is part and parcel of the investing experience, especially in sectors like technology where innovation is rapid and competition fierce.\nWhile these price swings may cause some to balk, seasoned stock market enthusiasts know that these fluctuations can present opportunities. Whether leveraging these movements for short-term gains or buckling in for the long haul, understanding the story behind the numbers is crucial.\nIn conclusion, the tale of NVDA and TSLA over the past month has been nothing short of a nail-biter. As we keep our eyes glued to the screens for the next series of movements, always remember: investing is not just about the figures; it's about seeing the whole picture and appreciating every twist and turn of the story that unfolds.\nStay tuned, fasten your seatbelts, and until next time, may your portfolio's story be equally thrilling and rewarding.\nTERMINATE\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
